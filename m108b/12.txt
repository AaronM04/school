Pyruvate kinase (PK)
    PEP -> Pyruvate (ATP is made)

    enol->keto conversion is what makes this downhill enough - > 10kcal/mol
        This is more than the ADP->ATP [delta]G
        (keto is far more stable than enol)

rate-determining steps of glycolysis:
    hexokinase,PFK,pyruvate kinase

in many of these reactions, the product looks very similar to the substrate:
    they may have very similar affinities - the product must not bind tightly!

regulation of pyruvate kinase
    (+): F1,6BP (one upstream of PEP)
    (-): glucagon (only in liver), ATP, alanine (one downstream of pyruvate)
        NOTE: glucagon is high when glucose is low

F1,6BP binds PK allosterically - causes conform. change; pushes enzyme to R state

How do we know ATP is also binding allosterically?
    the [PEP]-vs.-PK activity curve becomes more sigmoidal as [ATP] inc.
    when ATP is low, non-cooperative/MM binding of [PEP]

***slide is important: this is all physiology
    Pancreas secretes glucagon when blood sugar is low

    Glucagon targets only the liver in terms of its ability to target carbohydrate
    metabolism.
        - liver breaks down glycogen to glucose

    Adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine.
    Epinephrine is assoc. w/ autonomic nervous system:
        sympathetic: acetylcholine (in ganglia), norepinephrine (at ends)
        parasympathetic: acetylcholine (at ends)

    Epinephrine targets liver and muscle
        in the liver: it turns off glycolysis
        in the muscle: it turns ON glycolysis

    Unlike the brain, muscle has its own glycogen storage.
