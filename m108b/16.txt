Lecture 16

sun - drives rxn's away from equilibrium
    - allows you to do work (at equil., you cannot do work)

relationship btwn sun & carbohydrates:
    carbohydrates contain the energy of the sun


carbohydrates + O2 -> CO2 + H2O
    carbohydrates are the source of e-

    CO2 is carbon empty of electrons
    H2O is hydrogen empty of electrons

the electrons are being removed in the TCA cycle
    glycolysis prepares glucose for the TCA cycle

---
Evidence for the TCA cycle
    specific radioactivity = [Hot]/[Hot + Cold]

    Radiolabel remains 100% on C1
        succinate "scrambling"
        succinate dehydrogenase can't tell the difference, since achiral

<a) fate of the carboxyl carbon of acetate unit (Acetyl CoA)>
    first turn  - neither of the two CO2's is labelled
    second turn - the half-labelled carbons come off as two CO2's

    if we test this and it happens, it would be evidence supporting the TCA cycle model
    "pulse ### experiment"

***homework: do the same thing if the methyl carbon of acetyl CoA is carbon-14

stoichiometry of the TCA cycle:
    for every one turn of the cycle:
        1) 

        ###

        4) 1 GTP produced

regulation of the TCA cycle

most of the TCA cycle is regulated by substrate availability

control of citrate synthase, isocitrate DH, alpha-Ketoglutarate DH
    ###
    both acetyl CoA & oxaloacetate are _subsaturating_
    
    physiological conc. near the Km

[acetyl-CoA] is regulated by PDH activity
[oxaloacetate] is regulated by intracellular redox potential

malate + NAD+ <-> oxaloacetate + NADH + H+      delta G ~ 0; delta G nought is +7 kcal/mol
    this reaction is close to equilibrium

for ex:
    inc. exercise -> dec. NADH/NAD+ ratio
    dec. NADH, inc. NAD+ -> inc. oxaloacetate -> inc. citrate synth.

    increased exercise results in increased turnover of the TCA cycle

inc. NADH:
    reverses (not inhibits!) malate DH (NADH is the product)
    inhibits isocitrate DH and alpha-ketoglutarate DH (NADH is the product)

product inhibition vs. reaction reversal
    two conditions for rxn reversal:
        1. both products must be present
        2. must be thermochemically possible


---
anaplerotic rxns:
    these rxns drain off intermediates from the TCA cycle
    to fill this up, make oxaloacetate directly from pyruvate

mechanism of pyruvate carboxylase:
    oxaloacetate is nothing more than caboxylated pyruvate

    pyruvate + HCO3 + ATP -> oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi

    ATP + HCO3- -> carboxy phosphate + ADP

    carboxy phosphate + biotin -> ###

    biotin is in the active site of the enzyme

coordinate regulation of pyruvate metabolism
    how do we control this shit?

    pyruvate -> oxaloacetate        [ activated allosterically by acetyl CoA ]
    acetyl coA inhibits pyruvate HD     [ product inhibition ]
