pyruvate enters the mitochondria to initiate gluconeogenesis
    under starvation conditions, what is important on this figure?
        breaking down AAs into pyruvate => need pyruvate to form oxaloacetate
        malate is used to transfer e- out of mito. into cells
        glycolysis is inhibited in liver -> get glucose out for brain
        in liver: NADH high in mito. but low in cytosol
        fatty acids being broken down to make acetyl-CoA
        acetyl-CoA activates pyruvate carboxylase allosterically

    what are effects of ^NADH?
        inhibits TCA cycle
        reducing environment for doing oxaloacetate -> malate

    why reducing equivalents in the cytosol?
        reduce a carboxylic acid to aldehyde

PEP is a lot higher energy than pyruvate - steep hill

glucose + 6H2O -> 6CO2 + 2 FADH2 + 10 NADH

^ glycolysis + TCA cycle
-----
ETC

2 FADH2 ###

thermodynamics of electron transport
    ex: malate/oxaloacetate

        NADH + H+ -> NAD+ + 2e- + 2H+
    oxaloacetate + 2e- + 2H+ -> malate
    --------------------------------------
    oxaloacetate + NADH + H+ -> malate + NAD+

                    delta G^nought = -7 kcal/mol
                            delta G = 0

<battery slide>
    at negative electrode:
        2e- + oxal -> mal

    at positive electrode:
        NADH -> NAD+  +  2e-

thermodynamics of electron transport
    (by convention, list half-reactions as reductions)
    oxidation-reduction:
        NADH gives up electrons better than does malate
            => oxaloacetate ends up taking the electrons from NADH

    for full reactions, positive E means spontaneous

so: the progress of any redox rxn toward equilibrium,
    can be monitored either chemically or electrically:

        volts have the same dimensions as kcal/mol

    delta G = -nFE

easy to get electrons from NADH to O2

negative electrode:
    NADH -> NAD+ + 2e- + H+

positive electrode:
    1/2 O2 + 2e- + 2H+ -> H2O

Oxidation of NADH by O2 is highly exergonic
    NADH -> NAD+ + H+ + 2e-

    delta G nought  = -n*F*E^nought
                    = -2 * 23 kcal/mol/V * 1.14 V
                    = -53 kcal/mol

Biochemistry of electron transport
    1. pathway of the e- from NADH->O2
    2. chemiosmotic hypothesis
    3. synthesis of ATP

<intermembrane space, matrix>
    best model that fits most of the data

    electrons are passed off to a number of proteins in the inner mito. memb.
        three large ones:
            complex I,III,IV
            transfer e- from front door to back door
                (in that process, e- are going down an electrical gradient)
                this is coupled to protein pumping from matrix to intermemb. space

"Artificial respiration": experiments that led to understanding the sequence of
electron transport proteins

    mitochondria will sediment at a different rate than other organelles
    the mito. are still alive!
    also in mixture: ADP, Pi, buffering agent, salts
    O2 electrode - measure amount of oxygen depletion

Electron donor systems (throw the left into the above, and get the right)
    1) beta-OH-butyrate -> acetoacetate  (NAD+->NADH)

    2) succinate -> fumarate (FAD->FADH2)

    3) ascorbic acid + TMPD (electrons given to cytochrome C)
        - completely artificial

What is the order of the ETC proteins through which electrons are transported?

an inhibitor of a complex will inhibit both e- transport through complex AND proton pumping

Experiment: inhibitors of e- transport:
    rotenone/amytal - rat poison - inhibits complex I
    antimycin A - inhibits complex II
    cyanide - inhibits complex IV (because it contains heme)
