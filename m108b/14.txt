alcoa: focus on worker safety
    market cap.: $4B -> $28B in 13yr (1998-2011) - but inflation?
    - we trust people before they appear to deserve it, and _then_ they change the world.

review:
general decarboxylation:
    carbon-carbon cleavage of a carbonyl group that is beta to a carboxyl group
        - has resonance stabilization
    
    alpha: no resonance stabilization for carbanion

Thiamine pyrophosphate:
    aminopyrimidine ring - thiazolium ring (w/ acidic proton) -ethylene-pyrophosphate

    the N in the thiazolium ring has a net positive charge, which pulls the electrons toward
    it, making the H of the neighboring C more acidic
        w/o this effect: pKa ~ 30-40
        w/ this effect:  pKa much lower ###

Mechanism of pyruvate decarboxylation & oxidation by PDH
    Step 1: TPP-dependent alpha-decarboxylation
        TPP attaches to pyruvate
        now there is a quaternary nitrogen beta to the carbonyl in the pyruvate
        "classical beta mechanism"

complete PDH mechanism:
    pyruvate dehydrogenase: must be an oxygenation!
        TPP acts like a handle to transport an acetyl group around
            btwn pyruvate and lipoamide

        dihydrolipoyl transacetylase is the second enzyme in this reaction

        the oxidation state of the S's in lipoamide are both 3
        but the ox. states of the S's in acetyl-dihydrolipoamide are both 4
        electrons have been gained by S - reduced!

Pyruvate dehydrogenase:
    10e- in pyruvate -> 8e- in acetyl-TPP

Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle / Citric acid cycle)

two purposes:
    1) make ATP - complete oxidation of acetyl C's (& H's)
        we got two in glycolysis, but there are eight left!

    2) generation of precursors for synthesis of macro-molecules (using ATP)

major steps:
    1) formation of oxalosuccinate from oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA

    2) decarboxylation

    3) regeneration of oxaloacetate

oxalosuccinate:
    the 3 carboxyl groups are almost useless - oxidation states of 1
    the middle carboxyl group can be removed most easily because:
        when you take it off, there will be a resonance-stabilized carbanion
        result: alpha-ketoglutarate

    step 4 in the TCA cycle is exactly analogous to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
