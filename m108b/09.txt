Lecture 9

*** on MT: all [delta]G's will be div by 1.4 (10-fold diff in K_eq and MAR)

base-catalyzed aldo cleavage
    Review from end of lecture 8:
        need to have carbonyl on C2 and hydroxyl on C4
        need a base to rip the proton off the C4 -OH
        Schiff base covalently locks the substrate in the active site
            - it's a weak base, but it's there all the time
            - better e- sink than carbonyl O

(glycolysis continued)
    Step 5: isomerization of DGAP to G3P (???)

---2nd phase of glycolysis

NAD+ is the e- acceptor in reactions of the type:

    NAD+ and alcohol <-> NADH and carbonyl (and proton)

    NAD+ + CRR'H2OH <-> NADH + CRR'=O + H+

    ***know the mechanism!
        - alcohol: one H comes off as hydride (H-) and one as a proton (H+)
        - the hydride ###

Acid/base vs. redox:
    acid/base: protons transferred
    redox:     electrons transferred (with or without protons)

Glycolytic pathway
    phosphorylation
    C-C cleavage
    synthesis of chemical energy

***the second part of glycolysis is all about making ATP

Main theme of 2nd part:
    How you make ATP [see slide]
        problem: it's so steeply uphill (7.3 kcal/mol)
        ADP + 1,3BPG <-> ATP is downhill (-4.5 kcal/mol)

    happens in enzyme active site: GA3P <-> a thiohemiacetal <-> GA3PDH <-> 1,3BPG
    happens in solution:           GA3P <-> a gem-diol <-> -COOH <-> 1,3 BPG

        putting a phosphate on anything is always hard, but it's easier
        when the leaving group is S

            - the active site excludes water so the thiol pathway prevails

Making the second molecule of ATP:
    Phosphorylation of ADP via PEP
        (starting with G3P)

        the trick is dehydration

        end product is pyruvate

    Structural basis for high PO4 transfer potential of PEP
        PEP ----(-4.8)--> pyruvate (enol) + P_i --(-10)--> pyruvate (keto)

Net reaction of glycolysis:
    glucose + 2 Pi + 2 ADP ###

during exercise, purpose of glycolysis is to deliver energy (ATP) FAST!!!
glycolysis generates ATP ###

Reduction of pyruvate to lactate serves to replenish NAD+
    NAD+ keeps getting depleted
    NADH keeps building up
        - we have to replenish these to keep glycolysis running
            (lactate dehydrogenase can do this)

Fermentation in yeast:
    glucose -> pyruvate -> acetaldehyde -> ethanol
                 |
                 v LDH
    humans:   lactate

    basically the same enzyme in humans vs yeast
