Lecture 8

He will never focus on memorizing names of enzymes.

How to study:
    stay up to date
    memorize the concepts

Coupled reactions:
    Ex:
        Gluc_out        -> Gluc_in        +3 kcal/mol
        Na_out          -> Na_in          -5
        ---------------------------------------
        Gluc_out+Na_out -> Gluc_in+Na_in  -2 kcal/mol

    You need to eat high-enthalpy compounds.

Brain GLUT 1,3 has much lower K_m than liver GLUT 1,3 - higher affinity

Initial cleavage of glucose into 3-C units:
    glycolysis

    Glucose -> G3P -> Pyruvate

Proteins are conserved:
    the same 20 AAs are always used, which are sufficient for life

    there are 20^300 (~10^390) possible diff. proteins (more than the mass of the
    universe)!

    only 100,000 proteins used in humans

Small molecules are also conserved in biology
    - most small molecules in biology seem to be <500 Da
    - >10^60 in chemical space!
    - simplest organisms use 100; humans a few thousand
    Selection??:
        - atoms (C,H,O,N and others) were abundant on Earth
        - solubility: carboxylic acids, organic amines, phosphate are predominant

How crowded is it inside a cell?
    70% water
    30% macromolecules (300 mg/mL!!!)

Glycolysis:
    Two arms to the glycolytic pathway:
        1. Conversion of 1 molecule of glucose to 2 molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-P (G3P)
            - requires energy input

        ###

    first part: phosphorylation & cleavage
    second part: synthesis of chemical energy: NADH & ATP
        why is NADH considered energy?

Chemical strategy for C-C cleavage
    difficult to cleave a carbon-carbon bond
    either heterolytic or homolytic cleavage
        homolytic cleavage: two free radicals - extremely unfavorable
        heterolytic cleavage: generates a carbanion and a carbocation
            - also reasonably unstable
            - enter the carbonyl group (C=O) - stabilizes neighboring carbanion
                when unprotonated, they are resonance structures
                when protonated, enol/keto tautomer in equilibrium

        *** read about reactivity of carbonyl group in Lehninger

Next intermediate after glucose is fructose
    reason why: fructose can be cleaved: carbonyl on C2 and hydroxyl on C4
        (cleave between C3 and C4)

    (really phosphoglucose and phosphofructose, but not important)

Glycolysis:
    Step 1: Phosphorylation of glucose

    hexokinase puts phosphate on a hexose
        Km is low to ensure a supply of G6P, even when glucose levels are low

    but in liver, catalyzed by glucokinase: high (>5mM) Km
        ensures that liver doesn't deplete blood glucose, at low blood glucose conc.

    Step 2: Aldehyde to ketone isomerization (G6P -> F6P)
        ****Homework: explain why

    Step 3: Phosphorylation at C1
        ***PFK catalyzes a second phosphorylation
    
    Step 4: Cleavage (aldo cleavage)
        aldolase
        both products will have phosphate on them!
        mechanism requires carbonyl group at C2 and hydroxyl group at C4
        cleavage between C3 and C4

    Base-catalysed aldo cleavage - reverse reaction to aldol condensation
        *** need to know organic chemistry of how this works - see slide
        concentration of OH- has to be high: rips a proton off -OH
            negative charge is stabilized by forming carbonyl group
        keto of the resulting keto/enol tautomer is protonated

    ***substrate is locked into the active site, increasing its activity
        - by shift base(???) - a quaternary nitrogen that is positively charged
            even better e- sink than carbonyl oxygen

    ------ the above is the first part of glycolysis ------
