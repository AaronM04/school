Lecture 13

*** review is Girv 1004
*** office hours on Mon.; normal office hours on Tues.

*** midterm - don't go back more than 3 years:
    - thermodynamics
    - organic chemistry of glycolysis
        understand the chemistry behind the logic of glycolysis
    - cooperativity
        yeast experiments
        titrating F26BP to see change from MM

"Why > How > What   - start by asking Why"

epinephrine upregulates glycogen->glucose in both liver&muscle, but
whereas in liver, epi. downregulates glucose->pyruvate (glycolysis),
   in the muscle, epi. upregulates glucose->pyruvate

metabolic profile of the major organs
    Brain
        sole fuel source is glucose: cannot use FFA's directly

        ###

    Muscle:
        ###

    Adipose tissue:
        "we will cover this later"

    Liver:
        primary function for metabolism is glucose storage and release

        used to make FFAs (free fatty acids)

"this is the end of glycolysis - we will be responsible for the above on the MT"

1. Dehydrogenation by NAD+ or FAD (or FMN)

    a) NAD+  +  2e-  +  2H+  ->  NADH  +  H+

        - NAD+ / NADH is the ###

        ###

    b) FAD  +  2e-  +  2H+  ->  FADH2
        (a double bond is removed)
        
        FAD/FADH2 is usually _tightly bound_ as a prosthetic group of an enzyme

        all dehydrogenation reactions are catalyzed by dehydrogenases

2. Combination w/ O
    removal of e-'s by O which "pulls" e-'s away from the C or H nucleus.
    C or H becomes oxidized; O becomes reduced

    catalyzed by oxidases

    CH4     8 is the C's oxidation state
    CH3-OH  6
    CH2=O   4
    HCOOH   2
    CO2     0

Oxidation states of carbon:
    "how many e-'s does this C atom own?"
    C-H   +2
    C-C   +1
    C-O    0
    C-S    0
    C-N    0
    
    (note that in most textbooks the ox. state is the negative of the above)

Why do carbohydrates have less kcal/g than long-chain fatty acids (4 kcal/g vs 9.3 kcal/g)
    - carbohydrates are already partially oxidized

    (CHOH)n vs (CH2)n

Individ. C's can have different oxidation states:
    pyruvate:
        COO-    1
        C=O     2
        CH3     7

Oxidative metabolism:
    Production of chemical energy via oxidation of pyruvate

Oxidation of pyruvate occurs in mitochondria
    pyruvate->Acetyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH + H+     delta G is very negative (-8)

Pyruvate dehydrogenase - role of vitamins
    - links glycolysis & TCA cycle
        "the colors tell you what's important"

    the COO- of the pyruvate turns into CO2

    main idea: CO2 and electrons are being lost from pyruvate

Role of vitamins & cofactors in PDH
    1. thiamine
    ###

Discovery of thiamine (and vitamins)
    polished white rice - symbol of prosperity in Asia
        - beriberi!
        mentality at the time: all disease was due to presence of infectious agent
            due to presence of SOMETHING in the body
            "people tend to think inside their box"
        changed their diet to British diet (lima beans, fresh fruit, oatmeal) and
        deaths from beriberi went away

        "We think that what we know is _what is_."

"three types of ppl in world: foot soldiers, managers, and leaders (come up with new ideas)"

general decarboxylation
    "can't be done without a carbonyl next door"
    beta: <works>
    alpha: pyruvate - the carbonyl is too close!
        - need TPP (thiamine pyrophosphate)

TPP:
    thiazolium ring w/ a quaternary amine
        - has an acidic proton!
