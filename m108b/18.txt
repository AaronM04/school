Lecture 18 - gluconeogenesis(cont.)
slides: Lec._17.###

***big picture:
    glycolysis is there to make pyruvate, to provide to TCA cycle
    TCA cycle is where we take the electrons off
    this is really a course on the molecules of life

s-10:
    oxaloacetate is made from pyruvate in mitochondria
    why shuttle malate across mito. memb.?
        to make glucose you need ###
        100x fold difference ###
        need NADH from mito. into cytosol
        malate = oxaloacetate + 2e-

<fig. 14-19>
    can you name one AA that will directly feed ### pyruvate? alanine (amino vs. keto)
        transaminated to pyruvate, then goes into mito.
        if source comes from AA, we don't generate NADH in cytosol, so we have to
        get it from mitochondria (starvation conditions)
            => use malate shuttle

s-15:
    ***G6Pase is present only in liver and kidney; hence, these are only tissues that can support gluconeogenesis

s-16:
    G6Pase is a model for enzyme activity, not necessarily due to the enzyme itself
        - enzyme activity is a separate concept - important concept in biochem
        - some vitamins measured in units of activity (not mg or mM)
            measuring some biological activity

            in this case, measuring activity of glucose appearing on cytosolic side
            of ER membrane
            
                if we detected no activity, the naive conclusion is that something is dead

                not necessarily true; could be transporter problem (and G6Pase would be fine)
                    - we always measure enzyme activity in the lab

s-17: a defect in ###
    defect in either:
        active site itself or T1 transporter (no nat. mutations known in T3 transporter)

    liver extracts treated by freeze-thawing at -80C multiple times:
        completely breaks apart the ER membranes so that all proteins are released
            - incl. integral memb. proteins
        if before freeze-thawing, we saw no activity, there's something wrong
            if after, still no activity, then defect in G6Pase active site itself
            if after, there is activity, defect in either T1 or T3 transporters
                (but we haven't seen T3 defects, so probably T1)

s-18: stoichio###
    #

s-19: reg

s-20:
    ***have this as large print-out format
    F16BPase - AMP inhibits gluconeogenesis
    high energy charge activates gluconeogenesis, and inhibits glycolysis
    ***study this at home

s-19:
    if liver is exposed to glucagon, the signal is to inhibit glycolysis
        - we want to make glucose, not use it up
        - glucagon decreases F2,6BP levels somehow
            how?
       - result: glucagon inhibits PFK, and thus glycolysis
                and promotes ###

s-21: transcr
    if blood glucose levels are low, enzymes of glycolysis turned down transcriptionally
    we have to assume insulin does not effect gluconeogen. - don't know why
    ***know general effect of glucagon&insulin on these pathways - details not important

s-22: the gluconeogenic ... feeding/fasting
    that's why we break down proteins in muscle when starving
        => make glucose => feed brain

    follow the arrows

s-###:
    main substrate during exercise is LACTATE

main producers of lactate:
    fast-twitch muscle fibers
        genetic - enables sprinting
        good at anaerobic glycolysis

main consumers of lactate:
    ***heart uses lactate oxidation as fuel
    slow-twitch:
        good at aerobic
        high mito. density

s-01:
    true of all phosphorylation: if it comes from naked Pi, it must be oxidation

s-02:
    enzymes of ox. phosph. in the cristae membranes
    outer membrane permeable to all molecules up to 10kD
    inner membrane permeable to everything, even protons
        - absolutely proton-proof

s-03: 
    advantage of huge multi-subunits? osmotic pressure would be untenable

s-04:
    top: how many electrons oxidizable? 24 - collected into 2 FADH2 and 10 NADH
        summarizes glycolysis and TCA cycle

    bottom:
        summarizes respiration

    ***review delta G for final
