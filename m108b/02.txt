Lecture 2
------------------

99% of test stuff comes from lecture material

carbohydrates supply most of our energy

percentage is always mass/volume (g/mL)

Proteins are normally used for other purposes (struct, enzymatic functions) and
cannot be stored.

Reading:
    "Basic Thermodynamics" - on Gauchospace

    Lehninger section 1.3; 13.1

Metabolic Pathways:
    A <--> B <--> C <--> D <--> E

    "we, as individuals, cannot easily discern what is/isn't important"

    anabolic pathways - synth. molecules, often require energy
    catabolic pathways - degrade molecules, often liberate energy

    A <--> B:
        "if you have A, you always have B"
        "if you have B, you always have A"

    "you never know whether the reaction will go forward or reverse from only
    knowing the initial conditions"

    "the equilibrium condition is the FINAL STATE"
        "you can substitute 'equilibrium' with 'final'"

    "we know a rxn is at equilibrium for this one prevailing reason: if we
    observe the ratio of B:A over time, there is _no net change_."
            the equilibrium constant can be _any_ value, _rarely_ equal to 1.

    At equilibrium:

        B/A = K_eq

    Value of K_eq does not change

    "during the process of relaxation from initial conditions, that reaction can do work"

    the energy available to do work is called "free energy," [delta]G

    "if the ratio of B to A is 1:1, then the work that is done moving towards
    equil. is [delta]G^[naught]"
