Lecture 27
***end of course wil be leptin

what if we don't eat proteins w/ the specific AA ratio we are made of? AAs get degraded(?)

degradation of AA carbon skeletons
    color coded red: carbon skeletons easily converted to intermediates of TCA
    cycle, and pyruvate

        (net synthesis of oxaloacetate -> form glucose)

    color-coded yellow:
        glucogenic + ketogenic

        ketogenic: make acetyl-CoA or acetoacetyl-CoA
            cannot make a net amount of oxaloacetate

    Lys & Leu are the only ketogenic AAs - can _only_ make acetyl-CoA (and then
    ketone bodies)
        (all others are glucogenic or both)

    need to take in 1g protein per kg body weight to replace ###

Review:

kinetics of glucose transport
    low vs high Km

know PFK (F2,6BP vs substrate vs ### - effects on velocity)

chemical strategy for C-C cleavage

general decarboxylation
    beta - easy, because carbanion can be stabilized
    alpha more difficult; needs TPP
        "know mechanism of TPP"

"know oxidation states of carbon"
    alcohol -> carbonyl group

"know in detail NAD+ + alcohol -> ketone + NADH + H+ (e- movements)"
    also FADH2

***know experiments well; why being done; what information we get out of it
    glycolysis:
        yeast extract experiments

know what drives cooperativity
    R state binds ligand much more tightly
    most of enzyme exists in T state
    active sites talk to each other

logic of TCA cycle:
    carbon skeletons thrown away

    oxaloacetate is catalytic
    
    know reactions, and why they occur

"don't memorize any chemical structures"

know evidence that TCA cycle model is correct
    radiolabelling Acetyl-CoA carbonyl carbon
    where does it go?

gluconeogenesis - activated by high levels of NADH in the mitochondria

oxidative phosphorylation

40-50%
    TCA cycle
    oxidative phosphorylation
    know how to work w/ redox potentials

ox. phosphorylation experiments:
    know why O2 consumption stops, and why it starts again

know how to calc P/O ratios

ox. phosph.:
    complex III
        - mechanism
        purpose - convert 2e- to 1e- transport
        stoichiometries - H+ pumped per e-
        ***Q cycle

inhibitors of o.p.
    three types
        1. ###
        2. oligomycin
        3. uncouplers - dinitrophenol - punch holes in inner mito. memb.
            valinomycin & nigericin

starvation
    draw those fucking metabolism arrow charts

    know what role of proteins are and FAs

    skeletal muscle doesn't take glucose, but will take some ketone bodies
        takes pyruvate from alanine

ob/db mice - cross-circ experiments
    leptin receptor vs. leptin presence

G6Pase - membrane; transporters...
