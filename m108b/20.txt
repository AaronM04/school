thermodynamics of electron transport
    redox reactions are special in that they can be measured both chemically and electrically
        chemically with delta G
        electrically with E^nought

    E^nought reactions that are more positive are more favorable

biochemistry of electron transport
    1. pathway of the e- from NADH -> O2
    2. ###

<intermembrane space>
    electrons travel through a number of protein complexes

"Artificial respiration": Experiments...
    oxidation supplies the energy for ADP + Pi -> ATP
    
    the reconstitution of some aspect of life

Electron donor systems
    beta-OH-butyrate
    ...

<intermemb. space>
    "take this on faith" (and see Lehninger)
        small molecules inhibit specific targets in the cell

    Cytochrome IV - CN competes w/ O2

Question: what is the order of the ETC proteins through which electrons are transported?
    Why is this important?

    <graph of [O2] as a function of time>
        as O2 is consumed, the line goes down

        if you inhibit a complex, and electrons are coming in downstream, it doesn't
        make a difference

        complex I receives e- from NADH
        unsure about the following:
            complex III receives e- from FADH2 (which gets them from I)
            complex IV receives e- from ascorbate (which gets them from III)

Second Q: if you were back in the 1960s, and none of this was known, ###
    the oxidation of NADH or FADH2 by O2 is tightly coupled to the phosphorylation
    of ADP

***ADP is limiting!
    NADH, Pi, O2 (everything else) are in excess
    when the reaction stops, it's due to running out of ADP

O2 consumption occurs as a function of ADP phosphorylation
    a total of 90 micromoles of ADP are added
    an e- donor is also added.

interp. of results
    a) [beta]-OH-butyrate equivalent to NADH
        P/O = 90umol/36umol = 2.5

    b) succinate equiv. to FADH2
        P/O = 90umol/60umol = ###

    c) TMPD/ascorbate equiv. to ???
        P/O = 90umol/90umol = 1

from high energy to low energy:
    NADH -> ### -> O2

how many protons are pumped for every electron pair?
    we are offering a source and a sink for the electrons

complex I
    ***only know that it is the receptor for NADH
    reduces coenzyme Q --> QH2
        has a long isoprenyl tail
        adapted to a hydrophobic environment

    the mechanism of pumping won't be covered in this course
        - 4 protons are pumped out of matrix

complex II
    ***not a proton pump
    = succinate dehydrogenase (in TCA cycle)
    generates FADH2, which gives electrons to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q)

oxygen is bi-radical - there are two single electrons in their own orbitals
    - both of these are spin up
    - e- pairs are transferred with one electron spin up and the other spin down
can accept electrons only 1 at a time
problem: ETC starts with electron pairs...
    - answer: Q cycle in complex III

complex III:
    CoQH2 comes with two e- to complex III
    one e- is given to Cyt c
    ***Cyt c carries one e- at a time
    the other e- stays in complex III => goes into the Q cycle
    once another e- takes this path, the semiquinone (Q- radical) is converted to QH2

    in the inner mito. memb., always a certain ratio of oxidized:reduced Q

    for every 2 QH2 coming in, two (Cyt C + e-) plus another QH2 leave

complex IV (cytochrome oxidase):
    4 molecules (Cyt C + e-) received one at a time
    O2 gets its electrons one at a time here
