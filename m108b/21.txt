*** final is on Mon., 3/18
    - time pressure
    - don't come to the final thinking you can figure a final out (no time!)

"tell me a story about..."
    to do work, must be displ. from equilib.
    to be displ. from equilib., must be in steady state
    etc.

<oxidative phosphorylation cartoon>
    NADH and FADH2 are large small molecules (lol) - carry 2 e- each
    FADH2 are locked onto molecules, unlike NADH
    TCA cycle is happening below (in the matrix)

    these complexes are physical pumps that pump protons (H+)
    the energy to run these pumps comes from redox potential btwn. NADH and O2
    energy stored in electrochemical gradient across inner mito. memb.
        - this electrochem. gradient can do work

    F0 F1 ATP synthase is embedded in inner. mito. memb
        uses electrochem. gradient to drive ATP synthesis

O2 consumption as a function of ADP phosphorylation
    P/O ratio = number of phosphate molecules that can be transferred to ADP
    per O atom (not per O2)

    30umol O2 (from graph) * 2 = 60umol O

    90umol ADP (from graph) / 60umol O = 1.5   <--- P/O ratio

    "for every O atom, one and a half molecules of ADP can be phosphorylated"

Complex III
    Q cycle is a turnstile when you're on a date - only lets one of couple through at a time

<superoxide, peroxide, hydroxy radical>
    O2 is a diradical
    if you add a single e- to O2, you form superoxide, HO2* (after combining with H+)
        - a mildly toxic free radical
    if you add 2e- to O2, you form peroxide, H2O2 (after combining w/ 2 H+)

    O2 + 3e- -> H2O + hydroxy radical
    hydroxy radical, O*- is the most dangerous molecule in the body (strongest oxidant)

    O2 + 4e- -> 2 H2O, good


<superoxide dismutase, catalase>
    "won't ask this on exam"

---
Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase):
    has a heme group in center
    Cytochrome c delivers single electrons to cytochrome oxidase

    purpose of Complex IV is to sequester all oxygen free radicals until it knows
    that 4e- have come in - "it counts"
        - don't release product until 4 electrons have been received

    these 4 H+ are pumped in response to TWO pairs of e-, not one

10 H+'s are pumped per 2e-'s transported from NADH to 1/2 O2

    10 = 4+4+2 H+ for complexes I, III, and IV

The chemiosmotic hypothesis
    NADH used to make proton gradient; proton gradient creates ATP
    - the accepted model for coupling oxidation to phosphorylation

    - free energy of electron transport is harnessed by pumping H+ from the matrix
    to ###

Evidence that supports the chemiosmotic hypothesis:
    - used to be many explanations for how ATP produced from NADH

    1. e- transport correlates with generation of a proton gradient
    2. an artificial pH gradient leads to ATP synthesis in intact mito.
    3. complex I,III, and IV are proton pumps
    ###
    6. ATP synth occurs in artificial liposomes in response to light, if the ATP
        synthase is reconstituted w/ bacterial rhodopsin

            bacteriorhodopsin pumps H+ in response to light

free energy assoc. w/ electrochem. gradients
    the electrical potential across the inner mito. memb. cannot be arbitrarily large,
    because there is only limited redox potential available from NADH

    delta G = -m*F*delta(weird Greek symbol) - 2.3R*T*delta pH

    in respiring mito.:
        delta(weird Greek sym) = ~.18V
        delta pH = ~1 pH unit

        ###
        12 kcal/mol  (even though delta G^nought for ATP synth is 7.3)
        *** study this

ATP synthase:
    "the most fascinating nanomachine that man knows about - studied intensively
    so we can build machines like this"

    ***see Lehninger for how protons interact with the lipid bilayer to cause turning
    
    figured out in early 2005 - ATP synthase was crystallized

Coupling H+ translocation through ATP synth...
    the three subunits can adopt three different conformations:
        open binds nothing
        loose binds ADP + Pi
        tight binds ATP
