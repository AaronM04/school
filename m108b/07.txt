glucose is a 6-carbon sugar

alcohol + aldehyde -> hemiacetal
    anomeric carbon - when the straight-chain closes to form a ring

all sugar assays use straight-chain form

--
The glycosidic bond does not undergo mutarotation.

Conversion to a full acetal locks the sugar in ring form.

Thus, a non-reducing sugar.

****Homework:
    show mechanism for cyclization of D-fructose
        products?
    show mechanism for reaction of [beta]-D-fructose with MeOH
        products?

    (answer is online)

Disaccharides

[beta1-4] ###

*** need to distinguish btwn. alpha and beta, and D and L
       D    = H2COH on top in standard orientation
    [alpha] = anomeric carbon's other-ring or -OH bond is on bottom in standard orient.

Which carbon is the anomeric one? It's the only C with two O's coming off it!

Polysaccharides

All are repeating D-glucose
    Glycogen  ([beta]1,4)
    Starch    ([beta]1,4)
    Cellulose ([alpha]1,4)

Absorption of Glucose
    need to push glucose up a conc. gradient to get it from small intestine
    lumen into cell

        Na+ and glucose are coupled with the Na-Glucose Symport mechanism: Na+
        moves down conc. gradient, helps glucose move up conc. gradient

    Na+ is pumped back out into lumen, using ATP

    Glucose passively diffuses into blood stream through Glut 5
