High energy phosphoryl compounds:

Catabolism of food molecules serves 2 purposes:

    1. generation of precursors for synth of macromolecules
    2. gen. of free energy for energy-requiring processes

Free energy is required for:
    1. Mechanical work (muscle contraction)
    2. Active Transport of molecules and ions
    3. Synthesis of macromolecules

glucose vs. fructose - {aldehyde vs. ketone} derivative

ATP: H2O is able to attack phosphorus center at tail end of triphosphate

ATP <-> ADP + P_i          <---- [delta]G^[nought] = -7.3 kcal/mol

Chemical basis for large [delta]G^[nought] assoc. w/ ATP hydrolysis
    1. ADP is strongly e- withdrawing, which makes the [gamma]-PO_4 a better nuc.

    2. Greater resonance stability of the P's in ADP+P_i vs. ATP

    3. electrostatic repulsion

Standard free energies of hydrolysis of some phosphorylated compounds:
    Higher than ATP: phosphoenolpyruvate, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, creatine phosphate
                        (can phosphorylate ATP, since higher than ATP)
    ATP (to ADP)    -7.3 kcal/mol

    Lower than ATP: pyrophosphate, ###

Coupled reactions:
    Highly favorable reactions can drive moderately unfavorable reactions

    A <-> B+C <-> D   (first reaction is +5 kcal/mol; second is -8 kcal/mol)

    A <-> B+D         (net is +5 + (-8) = -3 kcal/mol)

    Interpretation: A<->B+C is "coupled" to C<->D
                    my interp: "if you want B, you can eat A and shit out D"

1. Physical coupling.
    ATP <-> ADP + P_i may be coupled to

    a) a conformational change ###

    b) Active transport of ions against a chem. gradient. eg. Ca2+ pump driven by ATP
       hydrolysis

2. Chemical coupling
    a) phosphorylating glucose is unfavorable (+3.3 kcal/mol)

       hydrolyzing ATP is highly favorable (-7.3 kcal/mol)

    b) ### creatine

Carbohydrates
    Why does the breakdown of a carbohydrate result in energy being released?
        You're increasing the entropy!

Fructose:
    The most important Ketose

    Occurs widely in fruits
    ###

Cyclization:
    Historically, two crystal forms of D-glucose could be demonstrated:
        A) One with mp = 146 degrees
        B) One with mp = 150 degrees

    When A was dissolved in water, specific rotation of plane-polarized light
    gradually changed from +112 degrees to +52.7 degrees.

    When B was dissolved, the specific rotation changed from +19 degrees to
    +52.7.

    aldehyde + alcohol -> hemiacetal

[beta] and [alpha] stereoisomers are called _anomers_
