We previously suggested the presence of microbial organisms on Mars that use a mixture
of hydrogen peroxide and water as an intracellular solvent as an adaptation to the harsh
Martian surface environment (Houtkooper and Schulze-Makuch, 2007). These putative
organisms would provide a consistent explanation of the observations by the Viking
Biology Experiments, in contrast with a purely chemical explanation.
The finding of surprisingly large amounts (0.4-0.6 wt%) of perchlorate salts in the
Martian arctic soil (Hecht et al. 2009) by the Phoenix lander sheds a new light on these
interpretations.
An interesting property perchlorate salts share with hydrogen peroxide is their effectiveness
as anti-freeze. Whereas the eutectic for H<sub>2</sub>O-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> freezes at -56<sup>o</sup>C, the water-magnesium
perchlorate eutectic is as low as -70<sup>o</sup>C. Therefore, Mg and Na perchlorate salts
might well be employed as an antifreeze by hypothetical Martian microbes. The reason we
still find H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> a more likely choice is the rapid evolution of O<sub>2</sub> in the Gas Exchange (GEx)
experiment, which is at variance with the stability of perchlorate under Viking's
experimental conditions, and also the fact that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be produced from only atmospheric
constituents.
At low temperatures on the Martian surface shortly before and after sunrise, the moisture
level is close to saturation. This means any Mg-perchlorate would attract water. The
apparent clumpiness of the soil, as well as what seemed drops of liquid water on one of
Phoenix' struts, support that notion.
The presence of perchlorates at a level of about 0.5% is surprising, because there is no
straightforward chemical production mechanism for these compounds to account for the
measured concentrations. The presence of perchlorates improves the habitability of the
Martian surface, particularly for xerophilic organisms employing a mixture of hydrogen
peroxide and water in their intracellular fluid.<P><P>

1. Introduction </B> <P> 
The Phoenix Lander landed on Mars on 25 May 2008. During five months, the
instruments on board explored the geology and climate of subpolar Mars and looked for the
presence and dynamics of water ice, and explored if life could have ever arisen on Mars.
Although the Phoenix mission was not a life detection mission per se, it looked for the
presence of organic compounds and other evidence to support or discredit the notion of past
or present life. <P>
Therefore, the Phoenix Lander can be regarded as a successor mission to the Viking
Landers of 30 years earlier. In 1976, these two spacecraft were the first two to successfully
land on Mars. Their main purpose was to answer the question whether extant life on Mars
could be detected. At that time, knowledge of the physical conditions on the Martian
surface was scant, so that the designers of the Viking biology experiments had to work from
what was known about life in dry and cold environments on Earth. Not surprisingly, the
results of the Viking biology experiments were puzzling. No complete consensus about the
meaning of the Viking results was reached among the researchers involved in the design of
the experiments, although the majority opinion was that one or more highly oxidizing
compounds in the Martian regolith were mainly responsible for the results (Klein, 1978,
1999). A different opinion was voiced by the researchers reponsible for the Labeled Release
experiment (Levin and Straat, 1979, 1981; Levin, 1997, 2010), who favored a pro-life
interpretation.<P>
A number of hypotheses have been put forward about the composition of the Martian soil
and its apparent oxidizing properties: Evolution of O<sub>2</sub> upon humidification was suggested to
result from one or more reactive chemical species such as ozonides, superoxides, and
peroxides (Oyama and Berdahl, 1977). Proposed inorganic oxidants include metal oxides
such as Fe- and Ti-oxides (Quinn and Zent, 1999) and superoxide ions or radicals (Yen et
al. 2000; Zent et al. 2006). Yet, a conclusive identification of the oxidizing compounds and
their productive process is still lacking (Atreya et al. 2006; Bullock et al. 1994; Crawford et
al. 2003; Horowitz, 1986; Levin, 2001; Ponnamperuma et al. 1977; Quinn and Zent, 1999;
Tsapin et al. 2000; Yen et al. 2000).<P>
Given the inconclusiveness of a purely chemical explanation, Houtkooper and Schulze-Makuch (2007) put forward the hydrogen peroxide-water hypothesis, entertaining the
possibility that extant life on Mars is based on a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water in
their intracellular fluid. This interpretation would have a number of attractive properties and
provide a viable alternative to the chemical explanation of many of the Viking results.
The recent findings by the Phoenix Lander, especially that the Martian soil contains
substantial amounts of perchlorate salts, shed new light on the possibilities for extant
Martian life.


<P> <B>
2. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O Hypothesis</B> <P>
The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O hypothesis (Houtkooper and Schulze-Makuch, 2007) turns out to fit the
results of the Viking Biology experiments remarkably well, in contrast to a purely chemical
explanation (Schulze-Makuch et al. 2009). Particularly, the evolution of oxygen upon
moisturizing the soil in the Gas Exchange (GEx) experiment (Oyama and Berdahl, 1977)
and the lack of detectable organics (Biemann et al. 1977) are to be expected if the Martian
soil contains organisms of which the intracellular fluid consists of a mixture of hydrogen
peroxide and water, instead of only (salty) water as is the case in terrestrial life. <P>
Why would organisms evolve to include hydrogen peroxide in their intracellular fluid?
The physical and chemical properties of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O mixtures would be beneficial for life to
cope with a harsh Martian near-surface environment. Any organisms on Mars would have
been subject to evolutionary pressures, as the Martian surface became colder, dryer, and
subject to higher radiation levels, to develop an adaptation to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, similar to how life on
Earth adapted to high concentration of free molecular oxygen about 2.5 billion year ago. <P>
The Martian atmosphere contains small concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Encrenaz et al. 2004;
2008). These are in the 10s of ppb range, and may be created by triboelectricity in dust
devils (Atreya et al. 2006), but are not in sufficient quantity to explain the Viking results.  <P>
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> shows superior properties as an antifreeze, a source of energy and oxygen, and as a
scavenger of water vapor. <P>
The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O eutectic mixture (61.2% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) freezes at -56.5<sup>o</sup>C and tends to supercool
below that temperature (Giguère and Secco, 1954). The mixture is hygroscopic because of
its low water activity and is also a source of oxygen and energy. The biological
compatibility of hydrogen peroxide has to be considered even though H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is mostly known
as a desinfectant. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is used for a variety of purposes, such as a messenger molecule in
the biochemistry of Earth's organisms (Rhee, 2006). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is produced in the peroxisomes of
most eukaryotic cells (De Duve, 1969) and the microbe <i>Acetobacter peroxidans</i> uses it in its
metabolism (Tanenbaum, 1956). While H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is often employed in defense mechanisms,
most organisms which come into contact with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> protect themselves with scavenging
enzymes such as catalase. The most eye-catching use of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is in insects such as the
bombardier beetle <i>Brachinus crepitans</i>, which produces a 25% solution of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to produce
steam explosions in a chitinous chamber in its posterior, which can be directed at a pursuing
predator (Eisner, 2003).  <P> 
Ambient conditions on Mars are often deemed adverse to the existence of life. Mars is
considered to be too cold and too dry, the soil too oxidizing, the atmosphere too thin, the
solar radiation containing too much UV and there is much hard radiation from solar and
cosmic origin because of the lack of a magnetosphere. However, some Earth organisms
show a remarkable resistance to UV and to various types of irradiation, and adaptations to
oxidative stresses and irradiation involve many of the same resistance responses in
microorganisms. <P>
The physical properties of mixtures of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O mean that the low temperatures and
the low water content of the atmosphere are conditions that allow the organisms with such
mixtures in their intracellular fluid not to freeze and to be able to scavenge water vapor
from the atmosphere. While H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O based life seems to be possible under Martian
ambient conditions, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a cellular component has its disadvantages as well: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a
reactive compound, although less so at lower temperatures, and the organisms may need an
active stabilizing mechanism to keep the organic cellular components intact. The organisms
would also need a mechanism to produce their own H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For this, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-producing
bacterium <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> and <i>Brachinus crepitans</i> provide an analog. <P>
The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O hypothesis implies that the addition of water vapor at a relatively high
temperature could only be withstood by the organisms for a short time, as they perished due
to hyperhydration (Houtkooper and Schulze-Makuch, 2007). Thus, the evolution of oxygen
in the GEx experiment is explained by the high oxidative content of the organisms. The lack
of detected organics by the Viking GCMS could be the result of autooxidation of the
organisms as these were gradually heated. Especially heating together with perchlorate salts
would result in combustion to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O of any organics present. And indeed, the
production of CO<sub>2</sub> was detected by the Viking GCMS (Navarro-Gonzalez et al. 2006).
<P> <B> 
3. Results from the Phoenix Lander <P> </B> 
Major results of the Phoenix Lander mission are the presence of water ice (Smith et al.
2009) with an ice table being within a few cm of the Martian surface in the subpolar region
and the presence of calcium carbonate (Boynton et al. 2009). In addition, the Phoenix
mission characterized the soluble chemistry of the Martian soil, revealing the alkalinity of
the soil with a pH of 7.7 +/- 0.5 and the detection of surprisingly large amounts (0.4-0.6 wt
%) of perchlorate salts in the Martian subpolar soil (Hecht et al. 2009).
The presence of perchlorates was primarily detected by the Wet Chemistry Laboratory of
the MECA package on board the Phoenix Lander (Kounaves et al. 2009), and was also
confirmed by the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA). <P>
The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) detected the perchlorates by using an "ionspecific"
electrode for different anions, apart from ClO<sub>4</sub>-, also for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. However, the
presence of a significant concentration of ClO<sub>4</sub>- overwhelms the response for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, so that
the biologically significant nitrate anion could not be detected (West et al. 1999; Kounaves
et al. 2009).
The detection of perchlorates may also shed new light on the interpretation of the Viking
biology experiments.

<P> <B> 
4. The Role of Perchlorates: Anti-freeze and Water Activity </B> <P> 
As an analog to Mars, perchlorate salts have also been detected on Earth in hyperarid
soils (Fig. 1). For instance, Ericksen found that the soils of the Atacama desert contain
0.03-0.6 wt% perchlorate (Ericksen, 1981). Perchlorate is thought to be produced by
atmospheric electricity or photooxidation (Miller et al. 2006). For Mars, the scarcity of
atmospheric oxygen could be a problem.

hygroscopic as well and could in principle attract water from the Martian atmosphere.

<P>


An interesting property perchlorate salts share with hydrogen peroxide is their
effectiveness as anti-freeze. Whereas the eutectic for H<sub>2</sub>O-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> freezes at -56<sup>o</sup>C, the water-
magnesium perchlorate eutectic temperature is as low as -70<sup>o</sup>C. Therefore, as Mg and Na
are prevalent cations in the Martian soil, their perchlorate salts might well be employed as
an antifreeze by hypothetical Martian microbes. Although perchlorates are known as
powerful oxidants, there is no perchlorate known to release oxygen upon moisturizing at the
Viking experimental temperature of about 10<sup>o</sup>C as was observed during the GEx
experiments of the Viking mission. Thus, we still consider H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> a more likely choice for the
agent causing the rapid evolution of O<sub>2</sub> in the GEx experiment. In addition, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has the
advantage that it can be produced from atmospheric constituents only.
What could be another role of perchlorates in addition to allow liquidity at lower
temperatures? Like some terrestrial plants living in extremely arid conditions, Martian
organisms may employ perchlorate salts to scavenge water from the atmosphere. Both
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O mixtures and concentrated solutions of perchlorate salts have very low water
activity (down to approximately 0.5 at the respective eutectics). The presence of perchlorate
salts on their surface would enable organisms to pump water into their cells at relatively
modest energy cost.

<P> <B> 
5. Discussion </B> <P> 
Xerophilic organisms on Earth are often also halophilic, occurring in hypersaline solutions
(Grant, 2004). Organisms on Earth evolved a number of organic (e.g., glycerol) and ionic
(KCl) solutes to obtain osmotic balance with the environment. The adaptation to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a
solute which is compatible with the cell content, would for Martian organisms enable
growth at very low water activity, comparable to that in concentrated perchlorate solutions.
The diurnal temperature cycle on the Martian surface is concomitant with a water
saturation cycle in the local atmosphere. At low temperatures shortly before and after
sunrise, the moisture level is close to saturation. For example, ground fogs were observed
by the Phoenix lander. This means any Mg-perchlorate would attract water. The clumpiness
of the soil, which posed such a problem for getting a proper sample into the TEGA
instrument of Phoenix (Fig. 2), as well as what seemed drops of liquid water on one of
Phoenix' struts (Fig. 3), support that notion.

several sols included repeated attempts to shake the screen over TEGA's oven number 4 to
get fine soil particles through the screen and into the oven for analysis. When analyzed, a
sample from "Baby Bear" showed an oxygen release consistent with perchlorate on Sol 25
(20 June 2008). </Dir> <P>

The fact that the upper few cm of the soil is crusted (Smith et al. 2009), together with the
nightly precipitation of water ice crystals (Whiteway et al. 2009) has also been found in a
parallel study of the migration of moisture in the soil of the hyperarid core of the Atacama
desert (Davis et al. 2009). The occurrence of substantial amounts of perchlorate salts, both
in the Atacama and at the Phoenix landing site, raises the question of the mechanisms
producing perchlorate in both places. The presence of nitrates could not be ascertained on
Mars, but for the Atacama a correlational study of the presence of perchlorates, nitrates and
biomass might elucidate possible mechanisms. <P> 
The presence of perchlorates at the Phoenix landing site, at a level of about 0.5% is
surprising, because there is no straightforward chemical production mechanism for these
compounds to account for the measured concentrations. The production of perchlorates by
putative organisms is therefore an alternative possibility - this could be a case of organisms
modifying their environment to serve their needs. The presence of perchlorates improves the
habitability of the Martian surface, particularly for xerophilic organisms employing a
mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water in their intracellular fluid.
