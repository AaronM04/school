<strong> <center> Abstract </center> <P> </strong> </font> <font size=+1 color="#000000"></font> </strong> 

A method is proposed to resolve the long-running issue of life on Mars. Based on the legacy of
the Viking Mission Labeled Release (LR) experiment, the method exploits the sensitivity of <sup>14</sup>C
respirometry. In 1976, the LR obtained positive responses at Viking 1 and 2 sites on Mars, but,
for a variety of posited reasons, the consensus favored chemical or physical agents in the Martian
surface material, not life. Since Viking, no life detection experiment has been sent to Mars.
New information about the Martian environment and the discoveries of extremeophiles on Earth
have re-energized interest in the possibility of living microorganisms on the red planet. The new
method, the "Chiral LR" (CLR), combines the LR with the chiral specificities displayed by
living organisms. The isomers of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled chiral substrates are separately injected onto soil
samples, which are then monitored for the evolution of gas. Small self-sustaining probes are
launched from the spacecraft in a manner protecting the original sterility of the probes. A strong
preference for one chiral isomer over its sister in an on-going reaction with the soil is evidence of
life. The new feature herein presented adds multiple controls to augment that supplied by a nonresponding
chiral isomer. The added controls increase the reliability of the overall result to the
point where an abiotic agent is difficult to propose. The results may solve the life-on-Mars issue,
and may, also, usher in a new era of comparative biology.

<B> 1. INTRODUCTION </B> <P>
The finding of extraterrestrial life is the Holy Grail of astrobiology. Discovery of life, even
microbial life, on Mars or any other celestial object would answer humanity’s age-old, plaintive
question, "Are we alone?" Minimally, we would learn that life does exist beyond us. A positive
result would raise the question of whether life began on Earth, on the other body on which it was
detected, or on some third, still unknown object. Depending on how the question was asked and
the reply, it might be determined whether we are related to the newly discovered life, or whether
it originated independently. The most intriguing result would be if the life detected were of
independent origin. This finding would strongly indicate that life is broadly distributed
throughout the cosmos. This would herald the dawn of a new era in mankind’s search for the
origin.
<P><B>
2. BACKGROUND</B> <P>
A high priority for NASA has always been the search for extraterrestrial life. In describing the
then-upcoming 1976 Viking Mission to Mars, NASA stated that the detection of life on Mars
would be "perhaps the most important experiment in the history of science." However, despite
this implicit urgency, the only direct experiments seeking extraterrestrial life remain those that
were aboard the dual landers of Viking (Klein et al., 1976). The Viking life detection
experiments were based on these assumptions: <B>1.</B> if any life existed, there would be
microorganisms (they seem necessary for the recycling of any more complex organisms that
might or might not be present, <B>2.</B> the life would resemble terrestrial life to the extent of being
carbon-based (carbon bonds to more atomic and molecular species than any other element,
including science-fiction’s favorite alien life component, silicon); <B> 3</B> the biochemical reactions
would be aqueous (water being the ultimate solvent, and so commonly available).<P>
One of the Viking life detection experiments, the Labeled Release experiment ("LR") (Levin and
Straat, 1976), was competitively selected for the Mars Mission in 1969, based on ten years’
development and demonstration of the experiment’s scientific rationale. Originally called
"Gulliver," NASA re-named the experiment the "Labeled Release Experiment (LR)" to better
describe its function. The LR dosed Martian soil with the <sup>14</sup>C-organic compounds shown in
Table 1, all of the "Miller-Urey" type thought to have existed on primitive Earth, and, likely,
Mars. <P><center> TABLE 1
VIKING LABELED RELEASE SUBSTRATES <br>

<img src="http://JournalofCosmology.com/images/LevinTable1a.jpg">  </center> <P> 




The headspace over the dosed soil was then monitored for the evolution of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled gas as
evidence of metabolism, and, hence, the presence of extant life. In the event of a "positive"
response, a control experiment was to be conducted to determine whether the positive had been
generated by a non-biological entity in the soil, not life. The control consisted of repeating the
LR experiment with a duplicate sample of the soil. However the sample was first heated under a
regimen thought destructive of microorganisms, but not of chemicals likely to cause a false
positive. This NASA-devised control was part of all Viking life detection experiments. If the
result of the control experiment was nil, or of greatly reduced amplitude compared to the initial
result, this was viewed as confirmation of the presence of living organisms in the original
sample. Conversely, a positive control would indicate that the "positive" was caused by a nonbiological
agent.
<P>
During one of the field tests of the LR instrument, a single drop of the labeled nutrient was
placed directly on the ground. The air above it was trapped and monitored over time for the
evolution of radioactive gas. Surprisingly, gas evolved immediately, with no lag phase as
experienced with larger volumes of nutrient. Figure 1 compares this "moist" method to the
"wet" standard method. Thereafter, the LR was designed as a moist experiment.
<P>
The LR approach is unique among life detection systems in that it is not based on static chemical
or physical properties in the sample, but on the detection of on-going metabolism. The method is
extremely sensitive, so that growth, which fails to register in more than 99% of soil
microorganisms cultured by standard methods, is not required.<P>
In the course of the development of the LR, thousands of laboratory and field tests were
performed in compiling a library of responses for comparison with possible Martian results. The
LR was shown to be effective in the rapid detection of a very wide range of microorganisms.
Laboratory tests included pure and mixed cultures of aerobic, anaerobic and facultative bacteria,
including autrophs and heterotrophs; chemotrophs; phototrophs; algae; fungi; lichen; halophiles;
and sulfur bacteria. Wild cultures were obtained from a variety of sources; and soils from
extreme environments, including many supplied by NASA, were tested. No culture or sample
that obtained a response from a standard method assay failed to respond in the LR test. A
number of LR tests succeeded where standard methods failed. The negative LR controls verified the
biological nature of the initial responses.
<P>
When laboratory tests were run with chemicals added to some soils, a chemical response
occurred. This happened only in several cases in the field where the pHs of the soils were below
3. In every case, the added or indigenous chemicals were revealed by their surviving the heat-treated
control. Thus, the very strong case for reliability of the LR was established. After a decade of
instrument development, the LR was successfully incorporated into the biology package of
Viking, which also contained the Gas Exchange (GEx) (Oyama et al., 1978) and the Pyrolytic
Release (PR) (Horowitz et al., 1977) life detection instruments. The Viking sampling arm
obtained the soil samples which were distributed to all three life detection instruments.

<br>Fig. 1. "Moist" vs. "Wet" Mode. The rapidly-responding moist mode consisted of 0.5g
Wyaconda (Md.) soil containing 10<sup>7</sup> organisms/g, 0.2ml nutrient including 14C-formate,
<sup>14</sup>C-lactate, <sup>14</sup>C-glucose, <sup>14</sup>C-glycine, and <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> (total activity: 20 &#956;Ci/ml). The slowly-rising
wet mode consisted of 0.3g of the Wyaconda (Md.) soil, 10ml nutrient including <sup>14</sup>Cformate,
<sup>14</sup>C-lactate, <sup>14</sup>C-glucose, <sup>14</sup>C-glycine, and <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> (total activity: 2 &#956;Ci/ml). The
control utilized the anti-metabolite. Incubation temperature = 25°C.

<P></center>
 <B>
3. VIKING ON MARS </B> <P> 
Both Viking 1 and Viking 2 successfully made their 400 million mile journeys. The LR
instruments operated flawlessly on Mars. Seen in Figures 1 and 2, both Viking landing sites,
some 4,000 miles apart, produced strong responses and virtually nil 160°C controls. The results
(Levin and Straat, 1976, 1979) met the pre-mission criteria for the detection of life by the LR. In a further
effort to distinguish between biological and non-biological agents, additional, more defining
controls were executed by commands from Earth. It was shown that the causative agent was
inactivated by temperatures as low as 51°C, and when previously active soils were sequestered at
10°C for sometime before approximately three months. Finally, to test the possibility raised that
the LR reaction had been caused by soil energized by exposure to the virtually unattenuated ultra
violet light reaching the surface of Mars, another experiment was improvised. At dawn, a rock
was pushed aside by the Viking sampling arm, and a sample taken from where the rock had
protected the soil from ultraviolet light over geological time. The LR test was run on the sample.
The results were positive, with the response being very similar to those of the other active runs.

<P><center><img src="http://JournalofCosmology.com/images/LevinFigure2.jpg">  

<br>Fig. 2. LR results at VL-1. A fresh sample was used for of cycles 1 and 3; sample for cycle
4 was stored 141 Sols at 10-26°C prior to use. In cycle 2, a stored portion of the cycle 1
sample was heated for 3 h at 160°C prior to nutrient injection.
<P></center>
<center><img src="http://JournalofCosmology.com/images/LevinFigure3.jpg">  
<br> Fig. 3. LR results at VL-2. Fresh samples used for each cycle, except cycle 5 sample stored
84 sols at 7°C. The sample used in cycle 3 was obtained from under a rock. Attempted as
50°C controls, cycles 2 and 4 were actually heated to 51° and 46°, respectively. Sample
volumes were 0.5 cc, except cycle 5, which contained 2.2 cc, including old sample.<P></center>


 In additional <i>ad
hoc</i> experiments, second injections of nutrient were added to active samples at the end of their
seven-sol runs. On Earth, those additional doses usually produced new rises in gas production as
the static metabolism was re-generated. On Mars, however, second injections produced
temporary declines in the gas levels already present. A search of the library of terrestrial soil
responses revealed that NASA-bonded Antarctic soil 664 had reacted to its second injection as
had the Martian soils. It seemed possible that, by the seventh day/sol of the test, the
microorganisms had died, and the decline in gas level was caused by re-adsorption of the
evolved gas into the dampened soil. <P>
Overall, the amplitudes and kinetics of the Mars LR results were similar to those of terrestrial
results, especially close to those of soils in, or from, frigid areas. The instruments’ performance
and data were unquestioned, but the consensus was formed that the LR had not detected life on
Mars, but had detected a chemical or physical agent that had produced false positive results.
<P>
The crucial factor in the formation of this consensus was another experiment aboard Viking.
This was the Molecular Analysis experiment ("GCMS"), named for its component gas
chromatograph and mass-spectrometer). It was designed to identify the organic compounds
commonly expected to be on Mars. It had assumed that the surface of Mars contains organic
matter in that Mars had been bombarded with organic-containing meteorites as had early Earth,
and because like Earth, Mars continues to receive large quantities of interplanetary dust particles
containing organic compounds. In addition, in the development of the Viking PR life detection
experiment, it was found (Hubbard et al., 1973) that organic matter was photosynthesized "in
significant quantities" from simulated Martian atmosphere exposed to simulated Martian
sunlight. Surprisingly, the GCMS (Biemann et al., 1977) detected no organic compound
whatever in the same soils tested by the LR. Thus, the results of both the LR and the GCMS
experiments were contrary to what had been anticipated by the most of the involved scientists.
<P> <B>
4. NON-BIOLOGICAL THEORIES AND EXPERIMENTS </B> <P>
Many theories have been proposed and numerous experiments performed attempting to account
for the Mars LR results abiologically. A review of the Viking LR evidence in light of the LR’s
strong performance on terrestrial soils, new data on the Martian environment, and the fact that no
abiotic experiment had been reported to duplicate the Mars LR test and control results, led the
writer, in 1997 (Levin, 1997), to conclude that life had been detected. The discovery of
perchlorates on Mars by the Phoenix Mission’s TEGA does not contravene this conclusion.
While perchlorates could produce an evolution of gas from the LR medium, they would easily
survive the heating regimen of the LR control.<P>
Over the more recent years, new data from Mars, including the report (Renno et al., 2009) of
current liquid water on the surface, the surprising findings of extremophile microorganisms on
Earth, in our most Mars-like environments, the failed attempts to reproduce the Mars LR results
abiologically, and doubts reported (Glavin et al., 2002) about the sensitivity of the Viking GCMS
to small amounts of organic matter have revived interest in the LR experiment. The Chiral LR
(CLR) experiment is designed to test the 1997 conclusion.
<P> <B>
5. THE CHIRAL LABELED RELEASE EXPERIMENT <P> </B> 
The CLR experiment has been proposed (Levin et al., 2002) as a means that can provide an
unambiguous distinction between non-biological and biological agents. The key determinant is
its ability to detect chiral preferences in the utilization of enantiomers of racemic substrates
applied to the sample. Strong preference for L-amino acids and D-carbohydrates is a peculiar,
still unexplained, property of all known living systems. On the other hand, such preferences
have not been reported as naturally occurring in chemical reactions. Recent work in the
laboratory has been reported (Castro-Puyana , 2008; Noorduin et al., 2009) to achieve up to 10%
enrichment of an L-amino acid. This is done by exposing a particular facet of a crystal mineral
to a racemic mixture of the acid, and then eluting that crystal facets. The amino acid
remaining on the eluted facet is slightly enriched, generally about one percent, in one of the
isomers. More recent research (Viedma et al., 2008) has significantly increased this enrichment,
with the thought expressed that it might even lead to self-amplification. However, even if such
abiotic selections occur, their presence in a compound would not produce a false positive in the
CLR. A continuing reaction showing a strong preference for one enantiomer of a racemic
mixture would constitute a clear distinction between living and non-living agents. This
conclusion would be further confirmed by the demonstration that a duplicate sample tested after
having been heated to life-destroying, but chemical-sparing temperatures produced a nil, or
greatly reduced, reaction when tested in the CLR.
<P>
Many biologists believe that phototrophs evolved as the first form of life. Thus, they propose
that phototrophs, but not necessarily heterotrophs, must exist on any planet harboring life. Based
on experiments, as shown in Figure 4, it has become possible to incorporate the detection of
phototrophs into the array of microorganisms targeted by the CLR.
<P><center><img src="http://JournalofCosmology.com/images/LevinFigure4.jpg">  
<br> Fig. 4. Detection of Photosynthesis of Metabolically Derived <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> from Chlorella
Pyrenoidosa. A white LED was incorporated into the CLR with means to pipe the light to
the soil sample. Should any microorganisms be present in the sample and evolve labeled
gas, turning the light on and off at two-hour intervals would produce a correlating
modulation in the signal amplitude.<P></center>

The CLR instrument (Levin et al., 2007) consists of individual, virtually self-sustained probes of
the smallest dimensions and weight practicable for deployment on Mars. The result sought is a
miniature, low-weight, low-energy-requiring instrument that could be used in multiples. They
could constitute an entire package for a small mission, be an integral part or be piggy-backed
onto a larger planetary lander, or be deployed from an orbiter. The probes would be packaged in
a canister that would be heat-sterilized before launch, thereby avoiding the necessity to sterilize
the entire spacecraft. On deployment, the probes would be ejected through the canister cover,
thus maintaining their sterility.<P>
The aim is for a design permitting 10 or more CLRs and support equipment to fit within the
weight and space limitations of small scale missions, such as Scouts, perhaps constituting the
entire science package. The deployment of multiple units provides two types of redundancy.
Should one unit fail to land safely, its duplicate would be available. Alternatively, another of the
units with different substrates could obtain the definitive result sought. The units are thus
independent and mutually supportive. As presently conceived the individual CLR probe is
depicted in Figure 5.

<P><center><img src="http://JournalofCosmology.com/images/LevinFigure5a.jpg">  

<br>Fig. 5. Chiral LR individual probe. Depending on loading, probes can serve as test and/or
control units.<P></center>

CLRs would be launched in the morning to take advantage of the rising temperature. Using its
integral battery, the temperature of the CLR is raised to 10°C just prior to launch. This ensures
liquidity of the nutrient so that it can moisten the soil. A weather vane platform allows for
launches to be upwind, away from possible terrestrial contamination of the landing site. If
desired the vane platform could be rotated to effect launch in a desired direction should an
attractive site be seen. The CLR is propelled by a squib. The launch angle allows for a
horizontal distance of approximately 100 feet. The CLR’s aerodynamics land it nose first, with
the penetration stops preventing it from going too far into the ground. The impact of landing
drives soil into the two sample chambers, breaking the ampoules and allowing the substrate
solutions to moisten the soil samples. The soil samples are then held at 10°C, the temperature, at
which the Viking LR samples were maintained (for possible comparative purposes), for five sols.
Any labeled gas arising from the soil sample passes through a permeable barrier installed for the
purpose of preventing the beta detectors from seeing the liquid and counting its radioactivity, and
also preventing dust or aerolsols from carrying radioactive material to the detector. As in the case with the
Viking LR, the radioactive gas in each CLR’s headspace is measured every four minutes for the
first four hours, to obtain early kinetics, and every 16 minutes thereafter. A preference in the
utilization of one stereoisomer over its mirror image would be strong evidence for life, very
likely accepted by a consensus of astrobiologists.
<P>
In the herein reported new iteration of the CLR, an important innovation is added. It is the use of
multiple controls. In the past version, each pair of the chiral substrates was viewed as its own
control, relying on the general acceptance that very strong evidence for extant biology would be
indicated by a preferential response to only one of the mirror-image molecules. However, an
alien life might not exhibit a chiral preference. In this case, the CLR would register a false
negative, unwittingly missing its paradigm-shattering quest. Hence, the Viking heat
"sterilization" is now included as a second control, but applied in step-wise heatings to determine
the thermal endpoint of the active agent. In addition, the imposition of other environmental
conditions would serve as important controls. These could include moisture, humidity,
atmospheric composition and the like. Further controls consist of anti-metabolites added to the
samples. While these are more Earth-centric, a variety of them could help confirm the test and
other control results. A reaction to only one of them could supply strong additional evidence.
Toxic metals, cyanide, antibiotics and enzyme inhibitors are control candidates, as is the de-coupling
agent 2,4-dinitrophenol. Pre-mission studies would establish priorities for the test and control
probes.
<P>
The new CLR, thus, inverts the normal concept of an experiment. Multiple controls are applied to
each test. A positive result combined with more than one nil control would be difficult to
explain away abiotically. Availability of instrument weight would determine the final package.
A chiral preference supported by multiple controls could indicate not only that extant life had
been found, but whether life were related to terrestrial life or were of independent origin.
Results from the various tests and controls could begin a study of comparative biology with
terrestrial forms.
