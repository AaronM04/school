O-glycans of different core structures/classifications
    Core1: Ser/Thr-alpha-GalNAc-beta3-Gal-beta3-<the rest>    <-- invariant

    ###

biosynth. of core 1 and core 2 O-glycans

O-glycans are not linear

----------------------------

synth of the dolichol-pyrophosphateGlcN###

    sugars linked to a lipid tail, but it's an intermediate; gets transferred to a protein

    same on all eukaryotes

    done by oligosaccharyltransferase complex
        attaches to Asn in Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X != Pro)

initial N-glycan processing in vertebrates
    N-glycans are trimmed down ("but in vertebrates, it is built back up")

common types of vertebrate N-glycans
    high-mannose / oligomannose   - only mannoses terminate the chains
    complex - sialic acid terminates the chains
    hybrid - mannose terminates some chains, and sialic acid terminates others

    may be useful for treating some diseases

multiple ex ###
    bi-antennary
    tri-antennary
    tetra-antennary

    most of the time in mammals, terminates with sialic acid

    in lower vertebrates (e.g., chickens): GalNAc

sequential processing by glycosyltransferases ###

dominant pathways of N-glycan maturation among different organisms

cell surface & extracellular N-glycans in phylogeny
    sometimes vertebrates express high-mannose structures - usually yeast, fungi

    the differences in mature N-glycans are detected by the innate immune system of vertebrates
        => inflammation
        may be related to auto-immune inflammation

glycolipid/saccharolipid biosynthesis: first steps
    ### ceramide???

    glycosphingolipids - common in brain tissue
        can have polysialic acid

the O (H), A and B ###
    ### blood group antigens

glycans that form the O(H), A and B blood group determinants on glycolipids

    H antigen
    A antigen
    B antigen
        "do not memorize these structures"

Poly-N-acetyllactos###

old world primates (us) all lack [alpha]1,3 galactose linkages in our glycans because of
null mutations in the genome that inactivate the gene encoding this transferase
    result: when we come into contact with this, we make Ab's to this

Glycans: the intracellular O-GlcNAc modification

The O-GlcNAc glycan linkage is found in the cytoplasm & nucleus of all multicellular organisms
    ###

O-GlcNAc is linked to glucose metabolism ###
    we convert glucose to UDP-GlcNAc (similar purpose to ATP)
        OGT enzyme

the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is regulated by mult. mechanisms
    TPR domain - Catalytic domain  ----proteolytic processing---> OGT splice variant

O-GlcNAc is found on many hundreds of proteins (substrates) and appears involved in
numerous cellular processes
    "seems to be a relationship btwn phosphorylation and this sugar linkage"

    "changes digital to more analog"
