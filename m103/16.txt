Two types of ER membrane domains:
    polyribosomes attached the ###


Cytosol to ER transport:
    General features:
        Translocator-mediated

        ER signal sequence required (often cleaved after translocation)

        bi-dir. transport (although it seems uni-dir. from the diagram)

        ###

    ER signal sequence versus:
        different types of transport signals of intracellular transport

        ###

    How do we know ER translocation occurs co-translationally?
        a) cell-free protein synth.; no microsomes present
            - post-translational introduction of microsomes: proteins stay outside

        b) cell-free protein synth.; microsomes present

    Overview of cytosol-to-ER transport ###
        *** "pay close attention"

        translocon - an ER transmembrane protein; can be open or closed
            complexed w/ SRP receptor (beta subunit, which is in membrane)
            new polypeptide chain goes through it into the ER lumen

    ER signal sequences
        short, hydrophobic - ~6-12 AA long - at N-terminus

    SRP: a complex

    ###

    SRP binds to the ER signal sequence

    Once bound to ER signal sequence, SRP interacts w/ the ribosome to pause translation

    Interaction of SRP & SRP receptor leads to ###

    SRP/sig. seq. communicate w/ the translocon to initiate translation

    SRP & SRP receptor also function to proof-read ER signal sequences

    Multiple functions of the SRP
        interacts w/ the signal seq.

    Translocation and cleavage of the signal sequence
        signal peptidase - transmembrane with a domain in ER lumen that cleaves sig. seq.

        problem: ER sig. seq. is hydrophobic, but goes into lumen
            ### "I don't have an answer"

    translocation of the nascent polypeptide chain by an open translocon (translocator)

    conformational changes btwn the closed & open states of Sec61 translocon
        "...the plug will fall away, allowing the chain to snake through"
        "the plug is maintaining the permeability barrier when ribosome is not attached"

    evidence for a tight seal on the cytoplasmic side but not on the lumenal side
        large ribosomal unit is creating a tight seal w/ the translocon
        
        experiment w/ fluorescent dye quenched by iodine

    gating model of the Sec61 translocon

    the ER signal sequence is often removed during translocation
        signal peptidase

    folding of the translocated nascent polypeptide chain
    
    folding of the translocated polypeptide chain requires ER chaperones

    recall: chaperones are required on both cytosolic & lumenal (matrix) sides ###

    why are chaperones needed only ###

    a common theme btwn. co-transl.

    ### require accessory proteins
        some proteins enter the ER post-transl.
