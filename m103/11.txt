Lecture 11 - Cell anatomy
    read Ch 12: 721-3
         Ch 14: 815-23; 838-9

***MT will cover through this Wed. lectures (lecture 12)

Organelles we will cover today:
    nucleus - nucleic acid synthesis
    peroxisomes
    ER - site of lipid and membrane protein synthesis
    Golgi ("GOLE-jee")

Various major anatomical features of the cell

polarized cells - cells that have specific surfaces

Nucleus:
    the eukaryotic cell nuc. contains almost all genetic info

    structure:
        nuclear envelope: inner & outer membranes
            outer is contig. w/ ER

        nucleoplasm inside
        nucleolus
            - ribosomes are produced

        nuclear lamina:
            on inside of nuclear inner membrane - composed of lamin

        perinuclear space (btwn. inner & outer membranes - connects to ER)

        Cajal bodies and GEMs - snRNP recycling

        interchromatin granules

        chromatin domains

    nucleus must get all its proteins from cytosol
    newly synthesized nuclear proteins enter nucleus through nuclear pore complex (NPC)

    NPC:
        each contains ~100 different proteins

        passive transport of small molecules through NPC: <9nm in diameter ( <60kD )

        transport of a ribosome by the NPC
            pore size can be altered - active transport

        evidence of active transport by the NPC
            gold particles coated with nuclear localization signal (a peptide)
            move from cytoplasm to nucleus - takes ~40min

Mitochondria:
    two membranes like nucleus
        intermembrane space
        matrix space (inside everything)

    structure of mitochondria: a closer look
    inner membrane has deep invaginations - very high surface:volume ratio

    75% of (inner?) membrane mass is actually protein

    movie: tomogram of mitochondrion
        ER often close to mitochondria

    function of mitochondria:
        1) ATP-generating factories required for life
            O2-dependent energy production

            prokaryotes: plasma membrane
            plants: chloroplasts
            other eukaryotes: mitochondria
            
            for each glucose metabolized:
                 2 ATP generated in cytosol (by glycolysis)
                28 ATP generated in mitochondria

        2) also play roles in signaling that controls cell death (apoptosis),
           cell div., and other processes

    active transport processes involved in mitochondria
        voltage gradient drives ADP-ATP exchange
        pH gradient drives phosphate & pyruvate import

    electron transport chain and ATP synthase generate ATP

    the ETC couples e- transport to the proton (H+) gradient

    the H+-ATPase couples the proton gradient to ATP synth.: general mechanism
    for oxidative phosphorylation
        ETC components & ATP synthase are located on inner membrane

    similar mechanisms are used to generate ATP in bacteria, plants, and animals

    ATP production by mitochondria

    proteins in mitochondria not necessarily coming from cytoplasm
        1% (37 genes in humans) is synthesized inside mitochondrion
            - 30 of these are linked to disease

    roles of mitochondria in cellular metabolism in addition to ATP production
        starvation conditions:
            use AAs to fuel ATP protuction

        cells relying on glycolysis for rapid ATP production:
            remove excess NADH from cytosol to further speed glycolysis

        conditions of excess:
            supply cytosol w/ excess citrate for synth of fatty acids & sterols

            supply cytosol w/ reducing power (as NADPH) for biosynth. using
            excess mitochondrial reducing power

Peroxisomes:
    single membrane structure

    utilizing O2 or H2O2 for oxidation

    functions of peroxisomes:
        breakdown of fatty acid molecules
            fatty acid molecules -> acetyl CoA
            ADL: adrenoleukodystrophy - disease

        involved in synth. of plasmalogens

        detoxification

    where do they come from?
        originate in ER (endoplasmic reticulum)
        
        proteins come from two different sources:
            cargo selection mechanism of ER
            cargo import mechanism of the new peroxisomes

    Zellweger syndrome: empty peroxisomes
        - kills human infants soon after birth
        mut. in gene encoding Peroxin 2 (Pex2)
