schematic ex's of major types of animal lectins
    galectins; C-type; P-type; I-type

glycans and lectins in protein binding and function
    lectins are proteins that have domains that bind glycans
    glycans in lectin-binding interactions
        promotion/inhibition of intermol; homo/hetero; promotion of intramol. binding

    glycans in steric effects on protein conformation and binding
        promotion/inhibition of intermol; homo/hetero; alteration of intramol. binding

---------------
(start of lecture 9)

glycans can contribute extensively to the mass & structure of proteins

*** know the different classes of glycans

saccharides can be modified ###

hyaluronan:
    hyaluronan consists of a repeating disaccharide composed of N-acetylglucosamine
    and glucuronic acid

    has extraordinary immunoregulatory properties
    hydration role
    part of ECM
    binds to growth factors (acts like a depot)

    hyaluronan biosynthesis
        made right at the plasma membrane

    hyaluronan capsule of Strep. zooepidemicus
        - binds to various extracellular molecules

    Link domain present in many proteins - binds to Hyaluronan

GPI anchors - anchors a protein
    GPI = glycophosphatidylinositol
    
    protein - ethanolamine - glucosamine (GlcN) - phosphate - lipid

    can have different numbers of C and diff # of double bonds in lipid
    invariant core: glucosamine + 3 mannoses + ###

Glycans: glycosaminoglycans (proteoglycans)
    proteoglycans consist of a protein core and one or more covalently-attached
    glycosaminoglycan chains

    glycosaminoglycans consist of repeating & different disaccharides
        sulfated at different carbons on the rings: -OSO3(-)

    the distinctions btwn heparin and heparan sulfate
        all cells make heparan sulfate
        heparin is a very potent anticoagulant - most successful drug of all time (tons/yr)

    the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain consists of different domains...
        IdoA - epimer of glucuronic acid - made by an epimerase

    chondroitin sulfate & dermatan sulfate are very similar to each other

    two types of keratan sulfate ###
        type 1: linked to Asn
        type 2: linked Ser/Thr

    initiation of protein O-glycosylation ###

    biosynth. of core 1 and core 2 O-glycans ###
