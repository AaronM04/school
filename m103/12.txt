Endoplasmic reticulum (cont.):

    The ER is a dynamic organelle

    Two types of ER membrane domains:
        rough ER - polyribosomes attached where the biosynth. of proteins takes place
        smooth ER - lipids are synthesized here

    different localization of polyribosomes
        polyribosome attachment mediated by signal sequence in mRNA
        SRP cycle
        discovered in part by electron microscopy; confirmed by sedimentation

    rough & smooth ER can be separated by their different densities
        ###

    Functions of the ER
        1. biosynth. of many proteins including
            a) proteins secreted to the cell surface/exterior - secretory pathway
            b) transmembrane proteins on the plasma membrane
            c) transmembrane or lumenal proteins of vesicular transport organelles,
                incl. ER, golgi ###
        
        2. biosynth. of most lipids (in smooth ER)

        3. intracellular Ca2+ storage (used for signalling)

    Molecular traffic patterns in the cell
        red arrows represent gated transport -  transport to/from nucleus

The Golgi apparatus:
    in an animal cell, it is polarized (unlike the ER)
    surrounds MTOC (microtubule organizing center)
    dividable into at least 5 diff. parts:
        ER -> CGN -> cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> TGN -> <plasma membrane,
                                                                        endosomes,
                                                                        secretory pathway>
    the proteins are maturing as they are transported through the Golgi
        (like an assembly line in a factory)

    vesicles bud off from the trans-Golgi

    functions:
        biosynth. of glycolipids
        covalent mod. of proteins
        mature protein sorting
        targeted secretion

    glycosylation: (three major struct. types)
        *** probably on exams
        N-linked glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) - begins co-translationally in the ER
        O-linked glycosylation (Ser or Thr) - begins after translation in ER or Golgi
            - diseases ER vs. Golgi
        Glycosaminoglycans (Ser) - post-trans., and begins in Golgi

        Sulfation - on select glycan linkages, and Tyr AAs of proteins in the Golgi

        Phosphorylation (rare in ER or Golgi)
            ###

    compartmentalization of protein mod's w/in the Golgi
        *** another cool slide

    one example: "Sequential" N-linked glycosylation
        (don't need to memorize)
        "these guys are really out of it - they don't use the correct nomenclature"

    Endo H is a specific endoglycosidase ###

    Endo H sensitivity is an indicator of ER-to-Golgi transport
        *** see slide

    how is the graded distrib. of a modifying enzyme maintained?
        retention/retrieval of Golgi resident proteins
            retention mechanism:
                transport vesicles leaving Golgi destined for PM have higher [cholesteral]
                and thus, a thicker lipid bilayer

                most transmemb. alpha-helix domains of PM proteins are longer (>20-25 AAs),
                while those of resident Golgi proteins are usually shorter (~15 AAs)

                    "this keeps the proteins in the Golgi - excludes them from export
                     vesicle carriers"

            retrieval mechanisms:
                "I will discuss these later - no time"

    protein sorting:
        usually occurs in later compartments
        Golgi is at the crossroads of biosynth. and recycling pathways

    targeted secretion:
        occurs in special types of cells (especially polarized cells - have apical&basal sides)

        the golgi & targeted secretion:
            secretion of mucus through apical surface

endosomes:
    endosomes are vesicles for transporting contents to and from plasma membrane

lysosomes (animals):
    vacuoles (plants)

    a collection of heterogenous organelles w/ a high content of hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases)

    pH is very low due to proton pumps ~ pH 5.0 (in cytosol, it is ~7.2)
        - hydrolases are often heavily glycosylated - protects them from proteases

    conventional functions of lysosomes:
        ###
        3 pathways leading to lysosomal degradation:
            ***know this!!!
            endocytosis
            phagocytosis - uptakes particulates (specialized endocytosis; not
                                                        all cells can do this)
            autophagy - (recently discovered)
                - can be induced by starvation
                - a process by which cytoplasmic organelles are selectively destroyed
                    (e.g., only mitochondria - destroys cells)

    lysosomal storage diseases:
        "no time - later in quarter, maybe"
        molecules normally degraded become accumulated in the lysosomes

        Inclusion cell (I-cell) disease  - (not on exams)
            - invariably lethal
            - lysosomal enzymes accumulate

    nonconventional functions:
        secretory lysosomes - "My lab may have something to do with this"

        present in multiple cell types:
            melanocytes
            blood cells
            mast cells
            ...

        A CTL is a cytotoxic T lymphocyte
        
        Rab27a is involved in the secretion of lysosomes (or lysosome-derived organelles) in
        several cell types.
            - modulates transport of melanosomes along cytoskel.

            - Rab27a-deficient mice display hypopigmentation (not only thing that's wrong)
                in humans: Griscelli syndrome (a form of albinism)
