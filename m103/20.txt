Functions of the endocytosis/endosomal pathways
    ###

endocytosis/internalization
    There are at least 5 diff. endocytosis pathways in mammals
    phagocytosis - particle eating
        - membrane moving outward to form large vesicles ~1um diameter
    pinocytosis - fluid drinking
        - membrane moving inward to form small vesicles ~50-100nm diameter

    phagocytosis
        properties:
            ###

        functions:
            1. a way of feeding (for protozoa)
            2. scavenging scenescent or dead cells (macrophages eat ~100billion
                scenescent red blood cells per day)
            3. protect against infection (by ingesting invading microorganisms)

    scavenging, fighting infection

    neutrophil - extends pseudopods around bacterium

    macropinocytosis as a powerful way to capture exogenous antigens
        diameter >1um
        a constitutive and non-specific uptake process in antigen-presenting cells

        formations:
            ###

        functions:
            1. a way of feeding
            2. antigen presentation (dendritic cells)
                - sampling the environmnet, so they can present it
                    trying to look like their environent
            3. cell migration

    clathrin-mediated endocytosis
        a constitutive and non-specific uptake process in antigen-presenting cells

        formation:
            ###
            2. present in eukaryotic cells from yeasts to mammals (highly conserved)
            ###

        functions:
            1. a way of feeding
            2. molecular homeostasis
            3. regulation of the cell surface density of a specific p.m. protein
                (due to the signal-mediated nature)

        clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a major internalization pathway in most cell types
            ###
            rapid recirculation of p.m.

        clathrin assoc. w/ adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2)...
            "medically relevant"

            apolipoprotein (ApoB in most cases) - LDL particle
                - carries cholesterol in membrane (also, esterified form inside)
                binds to LDL receptor on p.m.
                internalization mediated by clathrin

        a sorting signal on the cytoplasmic domain of LDL receptor (NPVY) directs...
            "NPVY" -> AP2 -> clathrin

        improper reg. of clathrin-dependent internalization & diseases
            atherosclerosis

            mutant LDLR w/ a defective endocytosis rate leads to increased
            blood cholesterol & heart attack

        formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) from the p.m.
            cargo recruitment
            ###
            ***interesting slide

        mult. signals exist for clathrin-dep. internalization
            "don't learn sequences; just understand that mult. signals exist"
            ...
            ubiquitin (diff. from poly-ubiquitin signals for proteasome degradation!)

        clathrin assoc. w/ diff. AP complexes at diff. sites
            "may be involved in differential regulation; e.g., neurons vs other cell types"

    ---
    caveolin-mediated endocytosis:
        "not much is known about these"
        caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations of the PM

    clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis
        little is known and much to be learned

---
endosomal (...) trafficking
    major compartments of the endosomal pathway
        first sorting occurs at early endosome
        two outcomes:
            fuses to form multivesicular endosomes (MVB), or
            recycled back to p.m.

        pH continues to drop as turning into a lysosome

    <skip "like proteins, many glycans..." slide>

    cargo proteins to be degraded...
        ### wut?

    protein trafficking via early endosomes...
        ***recycling back to the p.m. is a default pathway

    some membrane proteins are sequestered in endosomes
        "secretory vesicles in synapse of neuron"

        AMPA receptor

    geometric consideration of sorting at the early endosomes
        ###

    ###something important I missed

    early endosomes are the major sorting station of the endocytic pathway
        LDL particle is a nutrient
        receptor goes back to cell surface (sorted at early endosome)
        but cargo (LDL) is sent to lysosome
        dissociation is due to a lower pH

    the MVBs fuse with late endosomes/lysosomes...
        MVB - vesicles within a vesicle
        single ubiquitination does not result in degradation by proteasome

    multiple functions of ubiquitination
        signals for proteasomal degradation (UPR)
        ###

    how is a cargo sorted...
        ###

    what is the machinery...
        ###

    budding into a MVB is topologically similar to the virus budding at the PM
        ***wut? viruses?!?

    HIV Gag proteins are ubiquitinated
        virus is disguising itself as an endosomal vesicle

    budding of HIV virus particles from the PM

    multiple types of signals for sorting cargo
