protein transport into mitochondria
    general features
        mediated by TM translocators

        mostly uni-dir transport

        import sig. seq. required at N-terminus

        sig. seq cleaved afterward

        post-transl. import mechanism

        imported as unfolded protein

        molecular chaperones involved

    basic structure & topology of mitochondria
        outer membrane
        inner membrane

        intermemb. space
        matrix space

    two separate systems to gen. mitochondr. proteins
        the major pathway (99%) - from cytosol
        minor pathway (1% - 37 genes) - protein synthesized inside mitochond.

    transport machinery from cytosol->mitoch. transport
        outer memb:
        TOM complex
            entry port for all proteins from cytosol
            has translocation channels

        SAM complex
            works together w/ TOM - helps folding of outer memb. proteins

        both outer and inner memb - TIM 23 complex
            for some imported  matrix proteins

        inner:
            TIM22 complex
                ###
            OXA complex
                ###

    We will focus on cytosol->matrix transport
        cytosol -> matrix
        cytosol -> matrix -> other destinations (inner & outer membranes, intermemb. space)

    Overview of cytosol-> mitoch. matrix transport
        Hsc70 - a cytosolic protein that is a chaperone and helps to unfold proteins
              - uses ATP

        Hsc70 = Hsp70

        matrix-targeting seq.

    Cytosol-to-matrix transport is mediated by matrix-targeting sequences found w/in
    the N-termini of proteins

        Features of matrix-targeting sequence:
            ampipathic - both hydrophil. & hydroprob. residues
            20-50 AA long, but no specific seq
            at N-termini of imported proteins

    overview of cytosol-to-mitochondrial matrix transport

        chaperones are required on both cytosolic and matrix sides

        transport occurs via the contact sites btwn outer & inner membranes

    how do we know that import into the mitoch. can occur post-transl. in an
    unfolded state?

        utilize energized mitoch. to conduct an _in vitro_ reconst. mitoch. transport assay
            urea unfolds proteins -> can be imported without chaperonins!

   how do we know that import into the mitoch. occurs at contact sites?

    method 1: _in vitro_ ###
    
    the protein must be able to span the intermemb. space - thus, the space needs to be
    small enough => contact sites

    DHFR - cytosolic protein
        its folding status can be differentially controlled by chaperones or methotrexate

        can put matrix targeting seq. on its N-terminus
            DHFR-mts ----chaperones----> into the matrix
            DHFR-mts ----methotrexate----> stay in the cytosol
                    cannot form a stable interaction w/ the translocator (too short)

                    we know this by adding a spacer seq.

            DHFR-spacer-mts ----methotrexate----> stuck in translocator!!!

    Getting stuck:
        mts gets cleaved off
        folding at C-terminal end acts as a cytosolic "knot", preventing the whole protein
        from going through

    How do we know that import into the mito. occurs at the contact sites?
        ###

    Method 2 - in vitro reconst. mitoch. transloc. assay
        initial transloc of mts can proceed at low temp,
        but the subsequent transloc. of the bulk of the protein cannot.

        by performing the transloc at low temp, one can "freeze" the transport
        intermediate.

    Method 3 - imaging approach:
        gold conjugated particles & electron microscopy
            high sensitivity

            superior resolution

            high contrast

            stable signals

            diff. sized particles are avail.

            anti-DHFR Ab + gold particles coated w/ protein A
                protein A - bacterial protein w/ high affinity to the Ab's

    overview of cytosol->mito. matrix transport
        chaperones are required on both sides

        ATP is required on both sides
        
        proton gradient across the inner memb. is also required

    energy and chaperone requirement during cytosol->matrix transport
        cytosolic Hsp70
        matrix Hsp70

        H+ gradient required at an intermed. step, probably the transloc. of
        the mts across the ###


    ---
    cytosol->outer memb. protein transport
        doesn't happen that often

        goes into TOM complex -> bound to chaperones in intermemb. space
        next, goes to SAM complex and gets folded to outer membrane

    cytosol->inner memb. protein transport
        A)
            after the mts, there is a stop-transfer seq.
            becomes an inner memb. protein

        B)
            recruitment of both TOM and TIM23 complexes
            protein goes all the way through (see cytosol->matrix transport)
            second signal seq. recognized by OXA complex => inner memb. protein

                - also works for mitochondrially synth. proteins

        C)
            proteins end up in intermemb. space, but soluble, not integral memb. proteins
            protein has mts and stop-transfer seq. (see A)
            protease cleavage => soluble in intermemb. space

        D)
            TOM complex -> intermemb. space -> recog. by chaperones -> TIM22 complex ->
            
                -> inner memb. protein


----
Peroxisome transport

    mostly unidirectional: cytosol->peroxisome

    post-transl. mechanism

    weird(nobody understands): imported as folded proteins

    peroxisomes:
        single membrane (not two as in mitochondr.)

    peroxisomes: sources of peroxisomal proteins
        vesicles bud off the ER -> uptake of specific peroxisomal proteins &
                                    lipids from cytosol

        peroxisome -> fission -> two daughter peroxisomes

"what we know about it is really quite limited"
signal sequences for peroxisome import:
    for most imported proteins:
        (S/A/C)(K/R/H)(L/M)-COOH

    for some imported proteins:
        ###
