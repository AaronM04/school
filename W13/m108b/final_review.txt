inside the membrane, there's a big pool of QH2

transporting 4 H+ through Complex III (from matrix to intermemb. space)
electrons passed one at a time to Cytochrome C

how do we get get QH2:
    NADH gets oxidized (2e- come off)
    the 2e- go to Q => QH2; this consumes 2H+

    4H+ pumped from matrix to intermemb. space
        therefore 4+2 = 6H+ leave the matrix in total

complex I: 4H+ per NADH
complex III: 4H+ per NADH
complex IV: 2H+ per NADH
    total of 10H+ per NADH for all complexes

    10H+ / 4H+ = P/O is 2.5
            ^
            one O atom, I think

complex II: succinate oxidized to fumarate (2e- go to FAD) => FADH2
    (consumes 2H+ from matrix)

    2 electrons from FADH2 go to QH2, regenerating FAD

complex IV: four CytC come in; O2 + 4H+ + 4e- (from CytC) -> 2H2O
    and 4 H+ are pumped out of the matrix

high glucose => insulin => promotes formation of glycolysis

***know what these hormones do
    glucagon
    epinephrine
    insulin

***memorize the TCA cycle

ATP synthase
    open - no affinity for substrates
    loose - some affinity
    tight - forces the substrates together
    ...and releases ATP as going back to open state

    3ATP per 360 degree turn of F1 subunit

    12 H+ considering 4 H+ per ATP


***study glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase

phosphorylase gets phosphorylated
