fats only burn in the flame of carbohydrates

oxaloacetate required to break down acetyl CoA; oxaloacetate comes from carbohydrates

starvation:
    when we don't have any carbohydrate, we're really starving for oxaloacetate

    if no carbs, oxaloacetate comes from amino acids!

Pentose phosphate pathway:
    G6P from glycolysis  - 2H (and 2e-) are supplied by G6P at anomeric carbon
        the 2e- go into NADPH

    two more e- come off into NADPH

    result: ribose ###

###some slide here

<glucose, GA3P, fatty acid...>
    rate limiting step is from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA

the tricarboxylate transporter
    need acetyl CoA in cytosol to start synthesis
        citrate (= oxaloacetate + acetyl) shuttled out of mitochondria

<glucose, GA3P, fatty acid...>
    NADH very low
    NADPH very high (drives fatty acid synth.)

activation of acetyl-CoA
    isn't acetyl-CoA _already_ activated?
        we want to activate a different carbon, so we need to add HCO3 (from CO2)
    to produce malonyl-CoA; this process requires ATP

<figure 21-5>
    (see Lehninger)

    malonyl-CoA => fatty acid synth.

    fatty acid chain grows on center tall post

    occurs in cytosol of liver, transported out to adipose tissue

desaturation:
    involves oxidation: we want to convert saturated to unsaturated FA
        => electrons transported directly to O2
        O2 needs 4e- but FA only provides 2e-: the other 2e- come from NADH

mammals cannot introduce double bonds further out than C9
    therefore, essential FA's: (needed for memb. integrity and icosanoid(?) signaling)
        ###

regulation <control of FA synth.>:
    rate-limiting step is acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA

    on right side, regulation by phosphorylation
        enzyme exists in inactive (P'ase 2A causes this) and active form
        (AMP-activated PK causes this)
           cAMP activates P'ase 2A  => FA synth inhibited

           note: allosterically controlled enzymes are not synonymous w/ cooperativity

    ex: citrate:
        if it's abundant in cytosol, then acetyl-CoA is also abundant

        citrate turns _ON_ FA synth

synth. of palmitate receptors:
    8 Acetyl CoA
    7 ATP
    14 NADPH

synth. of triacylglycerol:
    FAs made in liver => transported to adipose tissue => converted to triacylglycerol

    glucose -> DHAP -> glycerol-3P

    glucose is required for the storage of fat

<glycerol-3-phosphate...>
    (he will not ask about this on the final :))

<glucose, VLDL...>
    ***important
    in adipose tissue, G3P must be made from glucose.

    G3P cannot be made from glycerol.

    thus, glucose is req'd in adipose tissue for synth. of TAG

    fatty acids come from VLDLs (delivery from liver)

    fatty acids -> fatty acyl-CoA -> combines w/ glycerol-3P to form triacylglycerols

    fatty acids can be recycled in same fat cell
    problem: glycerol cannot go back to form G3P

    if you are low in carbs, you cannot store FAs

regulation of body weight

obesity
    assessed by body mass index (BMI)
    BMI = body mass (kg) / height^2 (m^2)

    ideal BMI - life expectancy is maximal
    BMI 18.5-24.9 healthy
        25-29.9 overweight
        >=30 constutites "obesity"

Ob gene and Leptin
    1950 - two fat mice discovered: ob- (obesity) locus and db- (diabetes) locus
        both homozygous -/-

    1973 - cross-circulatory experiments
        ob- mouse becomes lean from wt mouse

        db- mouse stays fat, but wt mouse gets leaner

        ob- mouse becomes lean; db- mouse stays fat

    1994 - ob gene is isolated (cloned) - encodes blood-soluble protein: leptin

leptin is absent in ob-/ob- mice, but elevated 20x in db-/db- mice (compared to wt)
db gene encodes receptor for leptin
circulating leptin levels highly correlated w/ adipose tissue mass
leptin is the hormone that reg. body weight

<both mice are ob-/ob->
    mouse on right rescued by injecting leptin - lean
    mouse on left was not and remains fat
