EQUILIBRIUM (continued)

Review: change from 1:1 ratio towards equilibrium: [delta]G^[nought]


----

    [delta]G = 2.3RT log (B/A)_init - 2.3RT log (B/A)_eq

    2.3RT = 1.4 kcal/mol

    [delta]G = 1.4 kcal/mol * log ((B/A_init)/(B/A_eq))

Every 10-fold displacement from equilibrium requires 1.4 kcal/mol
    [delta]G =  1.4 kcal/mol * log (10_init/100_eq)

    [delta]G = -1.4 kcal/mol

What drives chemical reactions?
    entropy and enthalpy - "jargon: meant to exclude people from your world" lolz
    entropy:
        randomness
    enthalpy:
        if the pressure and volume remain constant, the energy associated w/ the
        rxn is the change in enthalpy.

    All processes favor: minimum energy, maximum entropy

[delta]G (or [delta]G^[nought]) is a measure of the extent of the reaction, not
the rxn rate

All processes are a compromise between:
    maximizing loss in enthalpy, and
    maximizing gain in entropy

[delta]H = [delta]G + T*[delta]S

STEADY STATE

In steady-state, the levels of intermediates _appear_ to be the same as their
levels at equilibrium.

equilibrium is synonymous with death(!)
