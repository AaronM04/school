oxidative phosphorylation

how do we keep glycolysis running? got to take away NADH and turn it into NAD+

fermentation in yeast
    ethanol is decarboxylated lactate
    difficult to measure lactate in humans, but in yeasts, you can measure CO2 evolved
    Buchner discovered you can do glycolysis with dead yeast cytosol

regulation of glycolysis
    names of intermediates and names of enzymes are not important

reg. of metabolic pathways by energy charge

                      [ATP] + 0.5*[ADP]
    energy charge = ---------------------
                    [ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]

if all in ATP form, energy charge would be 1
energy charge varies between theoretical limits of 0 (all AMP) and 1 (all ADP)

regulation of phosphofructokinase (PFK): cooperativity
    cooperativity - the concerted model

the fully saturated relaxed form behaves with Michaelis-Menten kinetics 
[ graph of receptor bound with respect to O2 conc. ]

For cooperativity:
    1) T0/R0 is large
    2) Affinity of S for R >> S for T

Hill coeff. (n) approaches # subunits

Sequential model - not as important
    [mistake in arrows for this slide]

Cooperativity - the concerted model (again)

Phosphofructokinase
    ATP encourages tense form, shutting the enzyme off
    AMP encourages the relaxed form, turning it on

    this makes sense
