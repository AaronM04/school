problem set 3


5:
    1) 
    2) step 7; also 1 and 5 (less obvious)
    3) ### and step 6 (because CoA being hydrolyzed off)
    4) 1,4,5,(9; also, note that it is reversed in gluconeogenesis)
    5) Ca2+ activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (step 1); released from sarcoplasmic
       reticulum to trigger muscle contractions
    6) step 10: <he draws biotin ring structure on the board>
            carboxyphosphate
    7) lipoic acid has a disulfide - redox
        helps us add CoA onto carbon chain

        step 1 and 5
    8) step 1 (PDH), because it is a good regulatory step

6:
    TPP mediates decarboxylation
    <he draws thiazolium ring on board - "really cool functional group of TPP">
    SN2 carbonyl attack - important mechanism for this class
        - attacks pyruvate

7:
    a) false
        - gluconeogenesis only occurs in liver & kidney
    b) true; dual function: during exercise, lactate needs to be taken out of blood
                            (avoid blood acidosis)
    c) true; FFAs (acetyl CoA is an allosteric activator of pyruvate decarboxylase)
        ***look at this
    d) true; glycolysis and gluconeogenesis work in opposite fashions w.r.t. glucose

8:
    in gluconeogenesis, the GTPase active site is in the ER lumen
    freeze-thaw experiments
    (problem: freeze-thawing tends to denature transmemb. proteins)

9:
    a) false
    b) true - only in liver and kidneys
    c) false
