[delta]G = the energy that's available to do work when rxn goes from initial to
           final/equil.

[delta]G^[nought] tells you the equilibrium constant, because the initial conditions
        are defined as 1:1

How do you keep something away from equilibrium and hold it there?
    ANSWER: put it in the steady-state AND introduce a rate-determining step
                    (reduced-flow in rate-determining step)

        cross out: The rate-det. step determines flow of overall pathway

If you know the equil. const., you know [delta]G^[nought]:

    [delta]G^[nought] = -2.3RT log K_eq

MAR_in = initial Mass Action Ratio


    [delta]G = 2.3RT log MAR_in  -  2.3RT log K_eq

    (in the slide, all the [delta]G's are zero except for the rate-limiting step,
     where it is -1.26; it's the only reaction that can do work -- it's the only
     rxn displaced far away from equilibrium)

    Only rxns whose [delta]G values are _large_ and _negative_ can proceed in the
    forward direction and do work.


    cross out: A change in "flux" through this step changes...
          AND: cross out "flux" and replace with "velocity"

How do enzymes work?
    - steady-state metabolic flow is controlled by enzymes


Reaction steps for conversion of Substrate to Product
    1. substrate binding (not really a step)
    2. chemical conversion
    3. product release

        Overall velocity = k_cat * [#S-bound E's]

Dependence of Enzyme Velocity on Substrate Conc.
    The more substrates that are there, the more prob. that a substrate will get into
    the active site of an enzyme

    The # of enzymes bound w/ substrate is always less than the # of substrate molecules
    present.

    follows a "law of diminishing returns" - adding more substrate will increase the
    number of E-S complexes, but less than proportionately
