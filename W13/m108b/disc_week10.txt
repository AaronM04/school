Problem Set 4 (continued)
-----------------

6d) rotenone inhibits complex I

7) dinitrophenol

    oligomycin: we will have O2 consumption w/ DNP; not necessarily phosphorylation
    cyanide: no O2 consumption

8) a) purpose of Q cycle: split electron pairs
   b) because you have to undergo 2 rounds of Q cycle

        two e- transferred per ubiquinol

        4 H+ per full Q cycle

9) a) add beta-hydroxybutyrate: pH change? go down, because ***ketone bodies are acidic
            ^ ketone body

        beta-hydroxybutyrate ----reduce NAD+---> acetoacetate ----> interact w/ TCA cycle

        acetoacetate + succinyl-CoA ---> CH2-C=O-CH2-C=O-S-CoA + succinate

        lehninger: "beta-hydroxybutyrate as fuel"

        a little bit of O2 consumption, then flat line

    b) add DNP: pH change? no change

        (DNP destroys proton gradient)

        O2 consumption? a lot, because of DNP keeps destroying proton gradient

    c) ???

10) B-OH & ADP - uses up all ADP, but we still have beta-hydroxybutyrate

    succinate & more ADP & _rotenone_ - succinate adds e- to complex II
        - O2 consumption: 60% of drop from beta-hydroxybutyrate

    ***know general amounts of e- and H+ for each complex

    if rotenone were omitted in the above? more of an O2 drop, because B-OH still present
            (complex I is functioning)

        look at proton ratios to get exact numbers


-----------------
PS 5

4) 
    glucagon:
        how would glucagon affect F6P->F1,6BP? reduced activity in the liver, and no
        effect in muscles

        acetyl-CoA -> malonyl-CoA? go down, because ###

        glycogen -> G1P? upregulated, because breaking down glycogen!

        TAG ->###? up, because FA breakdown

        cAMP levels? upregulate, because it's a messenger for low energy charge

        HMG CoA -> mevalonate? "don't worry about this"

    epinephrine:
        F6P->F1,6BP in liver? ###

        ...
