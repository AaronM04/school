*** review: basic thermodynamics
            basic reactivity of carbonyl compounds
                carbon electropositive
                oxygen electronegative
                nucleophiles react with carbon center

*** he will not test us on today

Energy Requirements for Humans
    1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
        - energy required for basic physiological functions

        - subject is at rest, awake, 12 hr postprandial, non-shivering

        - proportional to lean body weight and surface area

        Males:   ~1.0 kcal/kg body weight/hr
        Females: ~0.9 kcal/kg body weight/hr

        For a 70kg male: ~1681 kcal/day

        Tissue contributions to BMR:
            Muscle is 42% of body mass; others on list are all ~2%

            Heart cells have highest BMR of all the cells
                BMR_rel = 27.5

            "look at the overall picture for reading tables"
                ("there's a tendency to look at details")

        Process contributing to BMR
            Highest is protein turnover (23% of BMR), then Na+ pump (7.5%), and
            then Ca+ pump (6%)


    2. Physical Activity
        Light work - walking, housework, golf
            ~2.5-5 kcal/min

        Exremely heavy work - marathon running & other intense exercise
            > 10 kcal/min

    3. Thermogenic Effect of Food
        - aka "Specific Dynamic Action of Food"
        - Energy required to digest food
        - ####?

        Total caloric expenditure = ~2500 kcal/day

        eat 4600 kcal => gain 1 lb of fat
