cross-circulation mice (review)
    db-: defective in lectin receptor
    lectin from wt mouse has no effect; stays fat

    however, db- mouse has 20x as much lectin

###

target of leptin - ...
    leptin targets hypothal - ctr for appetite & control

    targets "eat less" neurons - turns them on

    targets "eat more" neurons - turns them off

leptin and obesity
    in humans - all obese subjects express some leptin; most express high levels

    therefore, not due to mutation in ob
        - unknown form of leptin resistance (not necessarily leptin receptor)

ob gene encodes leptin
db encodes leptin receptor

...
negative feedback - adipose tissue can "sense" leptin levels

if we eat too much protein, we also get fatter - here's why:

problems w/ getting rid of AAs:
    too much N - urea
    ###

alpha-amino groups removed by transamination
    transaminated onto an alpha-keto acid

    all transaminases require pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) as cofactor

most transaminases transfer amino groups from an alpha-amino acid to alpha-ketoglutarate

    alpha-ketoglutarate -> glutamate
    ###

only in liver:
    glutamate converted back to alpha-ketoglutarate
    N goes to ammonia, then to urea

how do we make urea?
    only know that ammonia combined w/ carbonic acid to form ... and finally urea
