Lecture 17

*** MT average was 39/60
    maybe a little ambiguity in question 5
    Mike has my test; give re-grades to him (limit 1)
        - make sure my concerns are not addressed by the answer key
    count up the scores
    gauchospace folder: "exam-related"

coordinate regulation of pyruvate metabolism
    FFA -> acetyl CoA
    "Acetyl CoA is never a problem during starvation, because plenty of FFAs"
    when Acetyl CoA builds up, inhibits PDH: product inhibition

    oxaloacetate is carboxylated pyruvate (by pyruvate carboxylase)
        Acetyl CoA promotes this enzyme by allosteric activation
            - favors formation of this enzyme's R state over T state



---
Gluconeogenesis

pancreas -> glucagon

brain will only use sugar for its metabolism (except starvation: ketone bodies)
    - holds about 190g as glycogen

    starvation: ^glucagon, ^epinephrine
        => liver releases 

    what happens when liver runs out of glycogen?

muscle is largest store of AAs in the body
    muscle proteins broken down, AAs released => liver => make glucose

if we want to go backwards: pyruvate -> glucose, we cannot use same identical pathways,
    because of huge delta G's

gluconeogenesis is not the reverse rxn of glycolysis; coupled to the input of ATP

easy:            FBP <-> PEP
hard: glucose <- FBP     PEP <- Pyr

Gluconeogenesis can use most of the enzymes of glycolysis in reverse ###

Pyruvate enters the mitochondria to initiate gluconeogenesis
    pyruvate is carboxylated to form oxaloacetate

    ***gluconeogenesis is activated by high reduction potential in the mitochondria
        if NADH levels are high, that's a signal liver is well-fed, and
        has ### potential to ###

        high NADH inhibits TCA cycle by product inhibition(?)


what is relationship btwn malate and oxaloacetate
    malate has 2e- more than oxaloacetate

A. circumventing pyruvate kinase - conversion of pyruvate to PEP
    1. carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate
    2. transport of oxalo###
    needs to be in malate form to go from mitochondria to cytosol -> converted back to
    oxaloacetate


3. decarboxylation of oxaloacetate followed by phosphorylation yields PEP
    oxaloacetate is carboxylated pyruvate

    ATP is required to put carboxyl group on PEP to form oxaloacetate (wut?)

    oxaloacetate's carboxyl group falls off easily

    oxaloacetate + GTP -> PEP + GDP + CO2


instead of swimming up the waterfall, we're going to go on a hiking trip around
the back side of the mountain

4. overall rxn
    ###

high NADH favors gluconeogenesis
    liver has high NADH even under starvation conditions

    ***homework: if converting oxaloacetate to malate, and then in cytosol, convert
            malate to oxaloacetate, why couldn't we have just had a shuttle?
                    
                    my speculation: can't have pores because H+ gradient needed

B. circumventing PFK - dephosphorylation of F1,6BP by F1,6BPase
    - take different path
        instead of putting phosphate on ADP, water comes in and takes the
        phosphate off F1,6BP

        PFK reverse rxn:  delta G nought = +3.4
        Dephosphorylation:               = -3.9 kcal/mol

C. circumventing hexokinase - dephosphorylation of G6P
    mediated by G6Pase
    G6Pase is present only in liver and kidney

    ***hence, these are the only tissues that can synthesize and secrete glucose into the blood

Glucose-6-phosphatase activity relies on multiple components
    ***lesson: enzyme activity

    catalytic site is actually on lumenal side!!!
        - that's a problem; transporter protein (T1) transfers G6P from cytosol to lumen

    if you give an enzyme substrate, and you don't see the product being made, you
        can conclude the enzyme is not working
        possibilities:
         1)  it's possible glucose is being made in the lumen, but not transported out
             into cytosol by T3 transporter

         2) ###
