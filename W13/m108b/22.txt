***final: study thermodynamics (electromotive force)
***anything not covered on the MT will probably be covered on the final

Coupling H+ translocation through ATP synthase w/ ATP synthesis
    loose binds ADP + Pi
    
    the process of going from loose to tight produces ATP

    the reason why we can form ATP from two single molecules in a single active site
    is because the conc. of these two molecules is exceedingly high

    cam shaft is rotating counter-clockwise in this diagram

    ***mistake: ATP and H2O leave; they don't come in

enol/keto isomerization

inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation
    1. inhibitors of complexes I, III, and IV
    2. oligomycin - binds directly to ATPase - blocks H+ transloc.
    3. uncouplers:
        a) dinitrophenol (DNP)

if you poke holes in the inner mito. memb., protons will flow through the holes,
decreasing the free energy avail. to ATP synthase

in the intermembrane space, the phenol is protonated => moves to matrix => loses proton

dissipates BOTH electrical and chemical gradient
    net carrying of positive charge and a net carrying of protons across

    (the DNP is catalytic)

b) ionophores
    i) valinomycin
        dissipates electrical gradient

    ii) nigericin
        dissipates chemical gradient (due to H+)

    (DNP has a greater effect than either of these because dissipates both)

c) thermogenin
    active component of brown fat
    acts as a H+ channel in the IMM of brown fat mitochondria
        uncoupling (and heat generation) occur only if plenty of FFA substrate is
        available. If not, ATP synthesis prevails

    the free energy becomes heat

ATP inventory
    ***for HW, rationalize the following

Fates of cytosolic NADH
    how does NADH get into mitochondria?
    enters via malate-aspartate shuttle

    cytoplasm: oxaloacetate reduced malate
    (malate goes into mito.)
    mito: malate oxidized to oxaloacetate (forms NADH)

next powerpoint: Lec. 21 Glycogen

<pancreas, adrenal medulla>

Glycogen
    branch points occur at ~1:10 glycosyl residues

    alpha(1-4) linkage
    branch point: alpha(1-6) linkage

    broken down at nonreducing ends - phosphorylase

    it's not water but phosphate that comes in.

    alpha1-4: phosphorylysis gives G1P -> G6P
    alpha1-6: hydrolysis gives glucose ---ATP---> G6P

    so, 10% of residues requires ATP

glycogen phosphorylase
    pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6)
    "not as important"

glycogen synthesis
    ###

activation of glucose-1-P
    when we activate a molecule, we make it more reactive (= higher energy)

    1. ATP
    2. carbonyl + HS-CoA + energy -> acetyl-CoA
    3. Glucose-1-P + UTP -> UDP-glucose + PPi

G1P + UTP <-> UDP-Glucose + PPi
                            (PPi -> Pi + Pi)   delta G^nought = -8 kcal/mol

once we have UDP-glucose, we can extend glycogen
    ###

Where does G1P come from?

    Glycogen <-> G1P <-> G6P  -> glucose
                                -> ###
                                -> ###

Isomerization of G6P to G1P
    G6P <-> G1,6BP <-> G1P

Details on glycogen breakdown/synth
    1. Glu-1-P + Glyc_n -> Glyc_n+1
        requires 1 ATP

    2. Glyc_n -> Glyc_n-1 + Glu-1-P
        90% no energy cost
        10% requires 1 ATP

    96% efficiency of energy storage(!!!)

Enzyme reg. - levels of complexity
    - M-M
    - cooperative (T vs R)
        - reg. by substrate conc.
        - reg. by allosteric ligands
        - reg. by phosphorylation  (our focus here)

glucagon/epinephrine 
    (secreted when blood sugar is low)
    in muscle/liver:
        phosphorylase will be phosphorylated: T->R
            makes sense because R form is more active, and 
        synthase will be phosphorylated: R->T
    in muscle:
        phosphorylase: also subject to regulation by energy charge
            AMP: ->R
            ATP: ->T
        no glycogen synthesis

        with muscles, we are using energy to go find food (unlike with liver)

Control by phosphorylation
