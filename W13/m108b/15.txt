***exam is to end of glycolysis (i.e., no TCA)

what's the theme of the TCA cycle?
    butchering the meat from the bones
        the meat: high energy e-
        the bones: carbon

carbon dioxide is electron-deficient

inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to practically everything (incl. protons, but not O2)
    - why can O2 cross? it's nonpolar

mitochondrial matrix:
    space where TCA occurs


glucose -> 2 pyruvate -> 2 acetyl CoA

glucose C1-6:  3+4+4+4+4+5 = 24
pyruvate C1-3: 2*(1+2+7) = 20
acetyl  C1-2:  2*(1+7)  =  16

24 - 20 = 4 WTF?
    the actual substrate that was oxidized is the thiohemiacetal that formed on G3P
        drives the formation of putting the phosphate on the ATP(???)

20 - 16 = 4 WTF?
    NAD+ -> NADH again
    hydroxyethyl ###

logic of isocitrate formation
    acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate -> citrate -> isocitrate

    oxaloacetate is regenerated with every turn of the TCA cycle - like a catalyst

    colors of this slide:
        blue   - 
        yellow - 

    move hydroxyl group one carbon over; then, oxidize carboxyl group where it was

logic of converting isocitrate to succinyl-CoA
    isocitrate -> oxalosuccinate -> succinyl CoA
        purple in oxalosuccinate - carboxyls come off as CO2

    middle carboxyl comes off -> carbanion stabilized by carbonyl -> protonated to form -CH2-

    bottom carboxyl needs TPP (thiamine) to happen - alpha decarboxylation

***follow oxidation states in the molecules of the TCA cycle!!!

[alpha]-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA is same mechanism as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)

when CoA is hydrolized, there's a large negative change in free energy - very favorable

succinyl-CoA -> succinate:
    large amount of free energy released
    that free energy is used to drive synth. of GTP from GDP and Pi

from succinate, we need to reform oxaloacetate, getting any electrons out that we can:
    succinate -> fumarate
        two hydrogen atoms are carried away by FAD, leaving an unsaturated carbon bond

    L-malate -> oxaloacetate:
        lose a hydride to NAD+

***in terms of electrons, the TCA cycle is in steady state
***track the electrons! the electrons are everything

two carbons are liberated from the TCA cycle - two enter via acetyl CoA
eight electrons are liberated - eight enter via acetyl CoA

For homework:
    4 oxygens are liberated - where do they enter?
    8 protons are liberated - where do they enter?

***logic of TCA cycle

Citrate is prochiral
    on the surface of enzyme, there are binding pockets for 3 of the functional groups

    in this way, it can distinguish the two ends of the citrate molecule

    always the methylene group from oxaloacetate that is oxidized

radiolabeling acetyl CoA
specific radioactivity = [hot]/[hot + cold]
usually very small ratio for radiolabeling
