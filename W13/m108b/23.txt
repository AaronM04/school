Lecture 23 (Lec_22._...pptx)

glycogen metabolism (continued)

glycogen is a very efficient way of storing G6P

synth requires 1 ATP; breakdown requires 0.1 ATP per glucose

if we start from G6P, we get 31 ATP (this is the denominator)

1.1 ATP / 31 ATP = 4% loss

cAMP sig. transduction cascade:
    there are drugs that bind to B-adrenergic or Glucagon receptor

    caffeine potentiates glycogen breakdown

    cAMP binds PKA (protein kinase A)
        PKA transfers phosphate to both phosphorylase kinase AND glycogen synthase
        the former is turned on; the latter is turned off

    the effects of glucagon are generally reversed by insulin, even though very
    different pathways

direct targets of PKA:
    phosphorylase kinase
    glycogen synthase
    pyruvate kinase
    PFK2 / F2,6BPase  <---- slide correction
    Hormone-sensitive lipase

Fatty acid oxidation
    Structure of FA's

saturated:
   omega      beta alpha
    H3C-(CH2)n-CH2-CH2-COOH

unsaturated:
    H3C-CH2-CH=CH-(CH2)n-COOH

    -O-C=O-R1
   /
   --O-C=O-R2
   \
    -O-C=O-R3

    storage form; when needed, the above esters are hydrolyzed

<HSL...>
under starvation conditions, we need FFAs (free fatty acids)
FFAs and glycerol backbone will both move to liver

glycerol -> 3P-glycerol -> DHAP (intermediate in glycolysis!)

<Table 24-1>
    omega 3's are a kind of PUFA (poly-unsaturated fatty acid)


fatty acids are synth'd and stored in liver cytosol
made from acetyl CoA

activation:
    fatty acid + ATP  <-> R-C=O-AMP  + PPi  (PPi -> Pi + Pi)
                        acyl adenylate


                        we drain off the products by a steeply downhill reaction

Carnitine transporter
    gets acyl-CoA to inside of mitochondria

beta-oxidation of FAs
    (compare w/ rxns of TCA cycle)

stoichiometry for the ox. of palmitate (16:0)
    why 1.5 instead of NADH's 2.5? FADH2 is further down on chart of redox potential

Ethanol metabolism
    Occurs only in liver

    CH3CH2OH --alcohol DH--> acetaldehyde ---aldehyde DH--> acetate
    alcohol leads to huge amounts of NADH production (both of above steps)

    how does acetaldehyde get from cytosol to mito.?

Metabolic conseq. of EtOH overload
    shutdown glycolysis (needs NAD+)
    NADH promotes production of lactate from pyruvate
    gluconeogenesis is severely attenuated (draining off oxaloacetate)
    in alcoholism, acetyl CoA has nowhere to go => turned into ketone bodies => ketosis

acetate ---"Thiokinase"---> acetyl CoA

###

second system: microsomal EtOH oxidizingsystem
    P450 cytochrome system
    requires O2 to generate acetaldehyde and acetate
    generates free O2 radicals -> tissue damage

    three phases of damage:
        fatty liver
        alcoholic hepatitis
        cirrhosis

        during starvation: inc. ammonia; usually converted to urea
        if not converted, goes into brain => coma / death

Starvation pathways in liver:
    oxaloacetate is what we are actually starving _for_
        (actually a catalyst for the TCA cycle)

        even after several days of starvation, we have lots of FFA, but we don't have carbs

    proteins are broken down in starvation
    alanine deaminated to pyruvate
    pyruvate carboxylated to oxaloacetate (requires biotin)
    ***avidin-biotin is tightest binding in biology - Kd ~ 10^15
    high NADH -> oxaloacetate -> malate -> glucose -> into blood!
    acetyl CoA builds up -> ketone bodies -> BAD (don't do Atkins diet)
