need rotenone to prevent oxidation of NADH

in liver (starvation conditions):
    Glucose -||-> pyruvate
        strategy: glucose needs to go into blood stream to power vital organs

    still need Pyruvate for Oxaloacetate

    alanine -> pyruvate, then pyruvate goes into mitochondria

    palmitate -> 8 molecules Acetyl-CoA  (beta-oxidation)

    pyruvate -||-> Acetyl-CoA (normal process is inhibited)
        (probably product inhibition)

    oxaloacetate -> glucose

    proteins and fats are used to run our bodies in the absence of carbs

    PROBLEM: acetyl-CoA -> ketone bodies
        cannot make a net amount of oxaloacetate from acetyl-CoA
            ***cannot make glucose (or oxaloacetate) from fatty acids

            a product of fat metabolism is only brought into the TCA
            cycle by combining with a product of carbohydrate metabolism

            "fats burn in the flame of carbohydrates"

    oxaloacetate is replenished from pyruvate, which comes from alanine

ketone bodies
    very acidic

    transportable forms of acetyl groups

in brain###
    ketone bodies -> acetyl CoA

in skeletal muscle:
    palmitate ---> acetyl-CoA (sometimes)
    ketone bodies -> acetyl CoA

oxidation of fuels by peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle & heart) under ### conditions:
    ###

major ketone bodies
    acetoacetate
    acetone
    beta-hydroxybutyrate

enzymatic pathway for formation of ketones in humans
    acetoacetate -> acetone by beta-decarboxylation, which happens very easily

24hr fasting:
    glucose down; glucagon up

starvation -> protein degradation (from muscle)
starvation -> inc. lipolysis (from adopose tissue) -||-> TAG
                                                   --> inc. ketosis
                                                   --> ###

utilization of ketone bodies
    ###

    sources of oxaloacetate:
        brain & heart - blood glucose
        muscle - endogenous glycogen, protein

Insulin
    first molecule to have hormonal effects
    1st ..., etc.

    Insulin is an anabolic hormone

Insulin is the single hormone which opposes effects of: glucagon, epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and others
    ###

<Table 51-3>
    in response to insulin, cAMP decreases

    and glycogen synthesis is favored

    glycolysis is increased => get acetyl-CoA => make FFAs

    gluconeogenesis is decreased

    ***slide modification: cross out HMG-CoA reductase

Insulin deficiency - diabetes mellitus
    the cells (the body) starve for glucose under conditions of severe HYPERGLYCEMIA!

    no signal to take glucose up into the cells

    our body thinks we're starving, though we're not

    ketone bodies -> metabolic acidosis

###type I, type II

metabolic responses to insulin deficiency
    everything is being mobilized to make glucose :(

glucose -> GA3P
    reduction is synonymous w/ biosynthesis
    NADPH is for anabolic reactions

    malonyl-CoA --NADPH--> fatty acid

    NADH/NAD+   ~    .001
    NADPH/NADP+ ~ 100

pentose phosphate pathway
    two functions:
        1) generate NADPH
        2) generate ribose-5-phosphate

    substrate is G6P
