Lecture 20 - Confidence Intervals

Central Limit Thm.
    X1, ..., Xn: simple random sample
    Large sample size (n > 30)

        xbar ~ N(mu, sigma/sqrt(n))

Significance level: alpha
    each confidence level corresponds to a significance level
        alpha = 1 - confidence level

    Ex: a 68% CI corresponds to sig. level equal to
        alpha = 1-.68 = .32

    CI for sig. level alpha:
        xbar - z_(alpha/2) * sigma/sqrt(n) < mu < xbar + z_(alpha/2) * sigma/sqrt(n)

        where alpha is the significance level and z_(alpha/2) is the z-score that
        corresponds to a prob. equal to alpha/2

Margin of Error
    CI for significance level alpha

        [above eqn.]

    where alpha is the significance level and z_(alpha/2) is the z-score that
    corresponds to a probability equal to alpha/2.

    The Margin of Error is

        E = z_(alpha/2) * sigma/sqrt(n)

Example: Vehicle's age
    In a survey of 30 adults, the average age of a person's primary vehicle is 5.6 years.

    Assuming that the _population s.d._ is 0.8 years, find the best point estimate of
    the pop. mean and a 90% confidence interval for the pop. mean.

        alpha = 1-0.9 = 0.1
        need z_(alpha/2) = z_.05 = -1.65

    best point estimate = mu = 5.6 years

    5.6 +/- 1.65*0.8/sqrt(30)
    ANS: 5.36 < mu < 5.84

Sample Size Calculation
    the min. sample size needed for an interval estimate w/ sig. level [alpha]
    of the pop. mean is

        n = ( z_(alpha/2) * sigma / E )^2

        the margin of error: E = z_(alpha/2)*sigma/sqrt(n)

        CI: (xbar - E, xbar + E)

Ex: what is the sample size?
    (avg. age of students in a college)

    sigma = 3 years; how large a sample is needed to obtain 99% CI w/ E=1?

    alpha = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01
    z_(alpha/2) = 2.58

    n = (2.58 * 3 / 1)^2 = at least ceil(59.9) = 60 students

CI's for the pop. avg. mu: unknown sigma
    large sample size (n>30), IID population
    small sample size (n<30), IID _normal_ population

Large sample size, IID pop.
        xbar - z_(alpha/2) * s/sqrt(n) < mu < xbar + z_(alpha/2) * s/sqrt(n)
    
    (note that there is s, not sigma, in the above; s is _sample_ s.d.)

Small sample size, IID normal population
    t-distribution

    the degrees of freedom (df) is the number of values that are free
    to vary after a sample statistic has been computed and tell the
    researcher which specific curve to use.

            df = n - 1,

    where n is the sample size.

    Confidence interval
        (xbar - t_(alpha/2)*s/sqrt(n), xbar + t_(alpha/2)*s/sqrt(n))

    with degrees of freedom n - 1.
    The values t_(alpha/2) can be found in the corresponding table in your book.

Ex: college wrestlers
    ###

Confidence intervals for the pop.

Ex: elections
    how to estimate the proportion of people voting for the republican candidate?
        p = proportion of ppl in the _pop._ voting for the Republican candidate
            (usually unknown)

        phat = proportion of ppl in the _sample_ voting for the R candidate


    approx. distrib. of phat
        X1,...,Xn are IID (SRS)

        if the sample size n is large enough from the CLT
            phat ~ N(p, sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) )

    68%-95% Confidence intervals for p
        When the sample size n is large enough we have that

            phat - sqrt(phat(1-phat)/n) < p < phat + ...

        is an (approx.) 68% confidence interval for p.

            phat - 2*...

        is an (approx.) 95% confidence interval for p.

        E = z_(alpha/2)*sqrt(phat*(1-phat)/n)

    suppose that in a SRS of n=100 Americans, we have phat=.3.  Compute 95% CI
    for population proportion.
