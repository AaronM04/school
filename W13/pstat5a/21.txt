null & alternative hypothesis
    H0: mu = mu_0
    Halpha : mu != mu_0

    A test of significance is designed to access the strength of evidence _against_
    the _null hypothesis_ ### _alternative hypothesis_

    Usually the null hypoth. means that there is "no effect" or "no difference"

Interp. of the null hypothesis
    default
    uninteresting
    nothing is happening
    there is no difference
    (we want to disprove this)

Interp. of the alternative hypoth.
    what might be happening
    ...

Alternative hypothesis
    Three types:
        Halpha: mu > mu0: one-sided test
        Halpha: mu != mu0: two-sided test
        Halpha: mu < mu0: one-sided test

Testing a new diet
    record how much weight lost by each subject
    null
        the diet has no effect
        mu = 0 because no weight was lost
            H0: mu = 0

    alternative
        the diet leads to people losing weight
            Halpha: mu < 0


P-value
    P-value is the probability, assuming that H0 is true, that the test statistic will
    take a value at least as extreme as that actually observed

    The smaller the ###

    Reject the NULL or not???
        compare the p-value with a fixed value that we regard as decisive

        that value is the significance level alpha.
