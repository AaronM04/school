Lecture 8 (actually finishing up lecture 7)

Review:
    Two types of membrane transport
    Transport across membranes: molecular considerations
    proteins can form membrane channels
    control of the opening & closing (gating) of a channel protein
        gated by:
            Vm (voltage)
            ligand-binding
                - ligand-gated (extracellular ligand)
                - ligand-gated (intracellular ligand)
            tension
                - mechanically gated

Transporters (carriers, permeases)
    A) carrier protein

    - not as rapid as diffusion through a channel

    types of energy used in active transport:
        co-transport
        ATP hydrolysis
        light
        electrochemical gradient (question: is voltage the only diff btwn this
                                    and co-transport?)


Active transport driven by co-transport
    The transport direction of black molecules is energetically unfavorable
    in both examples at the bottom of the slide. The transport direction of red
    molecules is energetically favorable. The energy released from the transport
    of red molecules can be used to drive the transport of ###

        [ see slide ]

An example of coupled co-transport: Na+--Glucose co-transporter
    usually there is a lot more Na+ outside the cell

Transport across cell membranes creates ionic gradients
    Table 11-1: A comparison of ion concentrations inside and outside a typical cell

    The origin of membrane potential: charge separation

        A very small amount of ion separation results in a large change of Vm
        (the overall ionic conc. w/in a cell is almost unaffected)

            - mainly achieved by ion channels

But how can an ion channel be selective for ions of different sizes?
    K+:   1.33 angstrom
    Na+:  0.95 angstrom
    Ca2+: 0.99 angstrom

        The basis for the selectivity of potassium (K+) ###

    The X-ray struct of a bacterial voltage-gated K+ channel provides clues on
    the specificity of ion channels
        [ see slide - selectivity filter ]

        how can it let large ions through but not small ions?
            water complexes with the ions; each has a unique energy of hydration

            in selectivity filter: only K+ but not Na+ is stabilized by the electrical
            interaction btwn the ion and C=O groups of those amino acids located at
            the filter.

                the C=O lines up to match the geometry of the K+ water molecules

                    K+ bonds with all 4, but Na+ can't - only two

Many human diseases and syndromes are caused by gene mut's or mis-reg. of membrane protein
ion channels

    K+ channel defects: hyperinsulinism, long QT syndrome, ataxia

==== end of lecture 7
("final stretch of cell components")
("there really isn't anything in your book that is up to date and accurate
    - there is no reading I can assign to you")

Cells are composed of 4 types of molecular components
    nucleic acids, proteins, glycans, and lipids

Glycans are monosacch's linked to other molecules by the glycosidic bond
    people tend not to think about cell structure or signaling when they think about glycans

Glycans cover the surfaces of all cells in a "glycocalyx" (~200nm thick)

    also contribute to ECM (in plants: referred to as the cell wall)

Functions of glycans:
    Structural:
        physical barrier
        tissue struct (porosity & integrity)
        protein folding & shielding from proteases and Ab's
        determinants of microbial & viral invasion

    Signaling:
        Energy storage (glycogen)
        Ligands of lectin receptors
        organization of lipid & protein complexes
        receptor activation
        storage depot for signaling molecules

Monosaccharides are the basic building blocks of glycans
    - in equilibrium btwn ring and linear structure
        Fischer projection for linear
        Hayworth projection for ring
        chair conformation for ring

            "still difficult to visualize"

[unpublished!]
***Monosaccharides used in the enzymatic process of glycosylation among life forms
    34 that have been identified for all forms of life

    for mammals: only 10 (for all vertebrates: 18)
        Fuc
        NeuAc
        NeuGc
        Glc
        Man
        GlcA
        GalNAc
        Gal
        GlcNAc
        Xyl

    but there are additional ones not listed in the above (e.g., GlcN)
        - post-glycosylation: epimerases

    none are essential in human diet - all made de novo

   ***know common classes of vertebr. glycans:
        glycosaminoglycans (proteoglycans)
        haluronan
        glycosylphosphatidylinosital (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins
        N-glycan
        O-glycans
        glycolipids
        intracellular glycans (glycogen, O-GlcNAc, ...)

    most extracellular via the secretory pathway

anomeric carbon atoms & positions in monosaccharides contribute to glycan
structure & function

    anomeric C: [alpha] is down, and
                 [beta] is up

Common types of glycan projections (note anomeric [alpha] or [beta] linkages)
    [ nothing here to memorize, except... ]
        in the symbolic representation, only one number of the linkage is shown
        because the other one is implied (e.g., sialic acid uses C1)

Mammalian glycan linkages produced by the enzymatic process of glycosylation
    (note: there are 2 forms of sialic acid)
    Y axis:
        - donors
    X axis:
        - protein & lipid acceptors
        - saccharide acceptors

AA consensus sequences or glycosylation motifs for formation of glycopeptide bonds
    - not always perfect consensus sequences

250 genes encode the enzymes of mammalian glycosylation
    typical glycan modifier domain:
        cytoplasmic - transmemb. domain - stem region - catalytic dom.

    Require high-energy monosaccharide donor and a monosaccharide ("aglycone") acceptor

incredibly specific reactions
    strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases
