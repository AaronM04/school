Lecture 13 - Molecular Trafficking and Signaling

Protein phosphorylation in molecular & cellular signaling

1992 nobel prize in physiology or medicine:
    Ed G Krebs (1918 - 2009
    ...

In most animals, protein kinases or phosphatases are divided into groups
depending on the phosphorylated AA:

    There are two common types:
        Serine & Threonine kinases

        Tyr kinases (and phosphatases)

At least 5 AAs can be phosphorylated among all life forms:
    Ser     Thr     Tyr    His     Asp(maybe)

Kinases often have multiple and regulatory domains

The major types of protein phosphatases (~150 total)
    PPA1 - Ser/Thr

    PP2A - Ser/Thr

    107 tyrosine phosphatases identified

    LIP - lipid phosphatases

Ex. of how kinases integrate signals in the generation of an output signal
    Cdk kinase activity turns on only if Cond1 AND Cond2 AND Cond3
        Cond1: has this phosphate been removed?
        Cond2: has this phosphate been added?
        Cond3: is cyclin present?

Activation of PKA by cyclic AMP (cAMP)
    two catalytic domains complexed to two regulatory domains

    when cyclic AMP is present, that small molecule binds to the reg. domain
    changes conformation, allowing phosphorylation of substrates

Activation of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) by Ca2+/calmodulin

Activation of PKC by DAG, Ca2+, and phosphotidylserine (classical PKC only)
    ###

Signal transduction is a cascade of events
    receptor on plasma membrane -> activation of protein kinases -> downstream signals
    "the vertical view of signal transduction, but it's also horizontal"

Sig. transduction cascades often branch across mult. pathways: vert. & horizontal pathways
    ***"that's why we will ultimately need some kinds of systems computation to understand this"

Examples of lipid phosphorylation & breakdown in signaling that contributes to
the functional specificity of cell compartments

    The problem: the compartments are all different - membranes alone don't generate
    functional specificity.

    Each compartment has its unique composition -- how is this generated?
        - how does the cell target molecules among diff. intracellular compartments


Phosphatidylinositol (PI) & Phosphoinositide (PtdIns or PIP)
    primarily found in the cytoplasmic leaflets of plasma membrane or intracellular membranes

    minor components of lipids (<=10%) but very effective signaling molecules

Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is a phospholipid containing inositol as the hydrophilic head grp
    inositol is a sugar but not a glycan: no glycosidic bonds!

    inositol-P-glycerol-(two hydrocarbon tails)

    Phosphate can be added to hydroxyl groups on inositol carbons 3, 4, and/or 5

Depending on the phosphorylated position, there are diff. kinds of phosphoinositides
    PI(4)P    - P on C4
    PI(4,5)P2 - P on C4 and C5

PI/PIP kinases and phosphatases are enzymes that phosphorylate or
dephosphorylate PI/PIP, respectively

There are seven possible PI-derived phosphoinositides: the conversions btwn them are controlled
by diff. kinases & phosphatases (only kinases shown in this slide)

Different kinases & phosphatases reside in different parts of the cell: therefore, diff.
PIPs are enriched in diff. parts of the cell

How do phosphoinositides (PIPs) contribute to cell compartment-specific signaling?
    different PIP species are enriched at diff. compartments
        => diff. PIP-binding proteins are recruited to diff. compartments to ###

There are many types of PIP-binding protein domains: each domain recognizes a specific type
or types of PtdIns/PIP

    "don't memorize"

Where do you expect a protein containing a PH domain and a protein containing a PX domain?

Proteins with different PIP-binding domains are recruited to diff. compartments of a cell

    claithrin
    targeted to p.m. because it has a PH domain

PI and PtdIns/PIPs
    1. both PI and PIPs are phospholipids (not proteins)

    ###

Lipid phosphorylation and breakdown in signaling that contributes to the functional spec###

Phospholipases are enzymes that cleave & convert phospholipids to fatty acids and PIPs

    phospholipids -> fatty acids + PIPs

Phospholipase C:
    How does PLC mediate signaling?
        binding of ligands to specific receptors at cell surface
            => PLC is activated
                => cleaves inositol from fatty acid
                    => DAG is left in membrane; IP3 is liberated

Intracellular transport - "the next half of this course"

[ polarized cell diagram ]

Almost all proteins are synthesized in the cytosol - need to target proteins

***Molecular traffic patterns in the cell
    gated - only btwn nucleus & cytosol
    transmembrane
    vesicular

Gated transport:
    transport via a gated pore btwn two compartments

    molecular transport btwn the cytosol and the nucleus

Transmembrane transport:
    transport btwn two compartments mediated by a protein or protein complex called a translocator

vesicular transport:
    transport from one compartment (donor) to another compartment (target) by a
    membrane-enclosed transport intermediate in the form of vesicle or tubule

    btwn cytosol and ER
        cytosol & mitochondrian
        cytosol & peroxisome
        cytosol & chloroplast

    budding from donor -> transport in cytoplasm -> fusion w/ target

    all of this transport occurs downstream of the ER: Golgi, etc.

Transport into intracellular organelles
    interior of nuc.: gated
    peroxisomes: transmemb.
    ...

Transport signals and signal receptors
    transport signals: fonud in a cargo protein

    transport signal receptor: found on the ###

Two types of transport signals
                unfolded protein <-> folded protein

    signal sequence is at N-terminal end (more common)

    signal patch is multiple regions that come together (less common)

Co- and post-translational protein
    co-translational: cargo protein is in an unfolded state (assoc w/ chaperones) during transport
