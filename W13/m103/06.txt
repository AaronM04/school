Lipids

eight lipid categories
    fatty acyls
    glycerolipids
    glycerophospholipids
    sphingolipids
    sterol lipids
    prenol lipids
    saccharolipids
    polyketides

### see slides ###

lipid synthesis (most built w/ ketoacyls or isoprenes):
    ketoacyls:
        Acetyl-CoA
        Malonyl-CoA
    Isoprene

Functions of lipids:
    structural:
        permeability barrier of a cell (plasma membrane)
        and cellular compartments (internal membranes)
    signaling:
        energy storage
        org. of cell sig. complexes
        sources of sig. molecules
