Lectures 22 and 23

Platelets change shape during blood clotting via complex rearrangements of actin...
    extend filopodia => later, spread out lamellipodia (sheet)

    platelets have a large pool of G-actin (sequestered by thymosin protein)

    clotting factors => burst of F-actin assembly

Accessory proteins:
    ###

(A) regulation of F-actin stability ...
    cofilin - actin depolymerizing factor
        its binding induces a conformational change: more twisted & weaker
        subunit-subunit interaction

    cofilin selectively binds to "D" form of actin (the older parts)

    tropomyosin - stabilizing F-actin by preventing binding of other proteins to F-actin

(B) cross-linking ###
    at least two actin-binding sites required

    fimbrin - monomer
    ###

[alpha]-actinin & fimbrin generate different F-actin bundles
    [alpha]-actinin - contractile bundle; loose packing; myosin-II can enter
    fimbrin - ### tight packing; myosin-II cannot enter

diff. forms of cellular F-actin

...

(C) severing of F-actin filaments by gelsolin
    gelsolin severs F-actin in the middle - remains bound as a cap on + end
        - the minus end rapidly disassembles

F-actin severing proteins inc. the rate of filament turnover
    Gelsolin-mediated F-actin severing increases the turnover rate
        (why? more ends)

Similar to the case of F-actin...
    MT stability: XMAP215
    MT bundling: MAP2 and Tau
    MT severing: Katanin

In cells where the actin filaments need to undergo constant assembly/disassembly,
the level or activity of capping proteins must be regulated
    PIP2 inhibits the activity of CapZ

listeria activate ARP complex - propelled forward by actin polymerization
