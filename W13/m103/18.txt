forward transport form the ER to the Golgi
    ###

    types of cargo proteins packed into the COPII vesicles
        1) proteins destined to later vesicular compartments (Golgi proteins,
           plasma memb. or secreted proteins, lysosomal proteins...)

        2) proteins required for the mobility, tethering/docking, and ###

    cargo too big for COPII vesicles?
        COPII vesicles (60-80nm diam) -> VTC -> Golgi
        "we don't understand"

        possibilities:
            1) some other transport mechanism
            2) different shapes and sizes of COPII vesicles that haven't been discovered yet

retrograde transport form the Golgi to the ER
    types of cargo proteins packed into the COPI vesicles
        1) proteins required for the mobility, tethering/docking, and fusion
        fusion of Golgi/VTC-derived carriers on the ER membrane

        2) escaped ER ###

    Two mechanisms exist to keep ER resident or mis-folded/mis-assembled
    proteins in the ER

        1) retention: preventing cargo from leaving ER

        2) retrieval: capturing cargo at a post-ER compartment (i.e., VTC/Golgi) and
            send it back to the ER

    Retrieval of ER-resident proteins
        for transmemb.-resident proteins:
            direct binding of KKXX to COPI coat

        for soluble/lumenal resident proteins:
            indirect assoc. btwnn KDEL and COPI coat via the KDEL receptor

        KDEL receptor captures the escaped ER lumenal resident proteins at the
        VTC/Golgi, brings them to the COPI vesicles, and returns them to the ER.

        Several intriguing questions regarding this transport event.

    The KDEL receptor is able to bind KDEL-containing cargo at the VTC/Golgi and release
    the cargo at the ER

    Lumens of vesicular compartments have different acidities (pH)
        ER is generally more neutral
        Golgi is more acidic

    How is the KDEL receptor able to bind KDEL-###
        binding affinity of KDEL receptor is very pH dependent

        released in ER (neutral)
        bound in Golgi (acidic)

    What causes KDEL receptor to localize to cis-Golgi?
        1) Golgi-retention mechanism
            - memb. thickness?
        2) a cargo-induced conformational change => recruits KDEL receptor-cargo complex
            into the COPI coat vesicle
        3) an ER export mechanism to return KDEL receptor to the Golgi

    What types of trafficking signals does the KDEL receptor have?
        (read in book)
        three trafficking signals:
            ###

Transport within the Golgi
    "still a black box"
    Vesicular transport model
        1) each Golgi cisterna is a static structure
        ###

    Cisternal maturation model
        1) each Golgi cisterna is a dynamic structure w/ forward movement
        2) no vesicle-mediated forward transport btwn cisternae
        ###

The Golgi lies in the crossroads of both biosynth. and recycling pathways
    The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is the main sorting station of the Golgi apparatus
        there are three major sorting pathways at the TGN
            1) signal-mediated diversion to lysosomes
            2) constitutive secretory pathway
                - to cell surface
                - this is the default!
            3) signal-mediated diversion to secretory vesicles (for reg. secretion)
                - special cell types

    Lysosomes are a collection of heterogeneous organelles w/ high content of
    hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases)
        hydrolases are lumenal enzymes
            often heavily glycosylated (protection from themselves)

        diff. types of hydrolases ###
