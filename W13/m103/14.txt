***[ 30 min late!!! see slides ]

GAP, GEF, and GDI regulate a small GTPase by controlling its GTP/GDB cycle

---
Importins (nuc import receptors recognizing the NLS)
Exportins (nuc export receptors recognizing the NES)

    different NLS & NES signals are recognized by different importins and exportins

    ###

Importins and exportins
    Ran-GTP binding causes release of nuclear cargo
