Lecture 17 - molecular trafficking and signaling

vesicular transport pathway (green on this chart)

[movie: example of a vesicle - a synaptic vesicle]
    v-SNARE ~70 copies
    V-ATPase - pumps H+ into vesicle
    other transporters coupled to H+ - e.g., glutamate pumped in
    tomogram

how vesicles form - budding from the donor compartment
    buddding of transport carriers (vesicles)

    budding: coat proteins and small GTPases

    types of coat protein complexes in a eukaryotic cell: three examples
        (A) clathrin
        (B) cop1
        ###

    different coats are involved in different transport steps
        COPII: ER -> Golgi
        COPI: Golgi -> ER
        Clathrin: transport from Golgi to other targets, incl. plasma memb.

        not involved in specificity of _donor_; only specificity of _target_

    triskelion organization of clathrin
        "soccer ball"

    [movie]
        triskelion
            3 heavy chains & 3 light chains
            globular domains at tips of heavy chains
                - interact with cargo memb. proteins
            assembly occurs spontaneously

    post-budding: I: disassembly of coat protein complexes after budding
        coat proteins fall away after forming the vesicle

    small GTPases act as a "molecular clock" to control the assembly & disassembly.
    of a coat complex

    how do a small GTPase and a coat work together to control budding?

    recruitment and activation of Sar1 GTPase at (and only at) the ER memb.
        Sar1-GEF - guanine nucleotide exchange factor
            - integral membrane protein of ER

        ***idea: catalog protein interactions with references to slides and/or notes

    ER-localized Sar1-GTP initiates the ###
        the recruiting protein hydrolizes GTP to GDP
        Sec13/31

    COPII components also select specific cargo proteins to be packed into vesicles

    post-budding considerations
        II: fission of transport carriers from the donor memb.

        ***eric terry: better class title: "MCDB 103: how to make a cell: we
        ***            don't know how to do that yet"; fascinating stuff

    Fission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the p.m.
       

    GTP hydrolysis initiates the disassembly of the COPII coat after budding
        causes entire coat complex to fall apart

    what would happen to the ER-to-golgi transport in the presence of a
    non-hydrolyzable GTP such as GppNp in a cell-free ###
        ***maybe on final

how vesicles move toward their target
    movement of transport carriers to target compartments
        use motor proteins (which are ATP-powered)
        move along cytoskeleton

        "nobody understands this"

    tethering & docking of transport carriers on target compartments 

    tethering & docking
        "two major players"
        Rab-GTP
        v-SNARE
        t-SNARE

    tethering proteins: Rab GTPases and Rab effectors
        Rab is a GTPase bound on the transport carrier
        interaction btwn Rab and Rab effector facilitates t-SNARE complex
        v-SNARE and t-SNARE ultimately lead to fusion
        60 flavors of Rab - different Rab proteins at different locations

    how does an activated Rab protein promote ###
        two forms of Rab effecters:
            1) long coiled coil
            2) large multi-subunit complex

    specificity of membrane ###
    
    how to recycle a Rab protein
        life cycle of Rab
        
    Rab proteins and their effectors have mult. functions ###
        there are so many Rabs because this increases the specificity

how vesicles latch onto target
    ### maybe some of above goes in this section

how cargo is delivered
    fusion of transport carriers ###
    
    [ movie: vesicle fusion (endosome ex.) ]
    
    specificity of membrane tethering/docking and fusion
        once close enough, SNARE complex can form

    SNARE proteins are integral or lipid-anchored ###
        the part that's embedded in the membrane is a small part
            - vast majority of it is in cytosol
        SNARE proteins display compartment-specific localization

    how do trans-SNARE complexes provide fusion specificity?
        1 will pair w/ 3
        2 will pair w/ 4
        other pairs don't happen - lock & key

    essential roles of SNARE proteins ###
    
    how does the formation of a trans-SNARE ###
        when v-SNARE(synaptobrevin)+t-SNARE(syntaxin)+t-SNARE(###) complex is
        formed, melting temp of ~90C
            because of this strong force, membranes start to fuse w/ each
            other

    NSF utilizes ATP to pry apart the cis-SNARE complex
        cis- because just one membrane now
        NSF: N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein
