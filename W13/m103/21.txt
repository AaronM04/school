Introduction of diff. types of cytoskeleton
[ 15 min late ]

Why link multiple protofilaments to form filaments?
    ###

Different mechanical properties of F-actin, MT, and IF
    ###

Actin filaments (F-actin):
    present in all eukaryotic cells
    G-actin is the monomer; F-actin is the filament
    highly dynamic
    most enriched in the cortex (just under the p.m.)

    short-range intracellular transport by the motor proteins myosins

    [Actin movement by myosin motors: movie]
        myosin attached to glass slide

    actin monomers & actin filaments:
        actin is an ATPase
        new filaments have ATP in them
        old filaments have ADP in them

        have polarity: + and - ends

        ### helical

Intermediate filaments
    no polarity to them

    one type forms the nuclear lamina; other types extend across the cytoplasm

    less dynamic than F-actin and MT, but much more strength and structural integrity

    Major types of IF filament proteins in vertebrate cells
        "don't memorize"
        nuclear
        vimentin-like
        epithelial
        axonal

    Skin blistering caused by mutations in keratin genes
        problem with formation of intermediate filaments

        cells slough off

        human epidermolysis bullosa simplex
            skin very fragile and blisters easily

    A model of intermediate filament formation
        staggered tetramer of two coiled-coil dimers =>
        eight tetramers twisted into a ropelike fragment => 10nm diameter


Microtubules (MT)
    highly dynamic structure

    during interphase: the - end is attached to the MTOC, and + end extends to
    cell periphery

    some functions:
        long-range intracellular transport
        motor proteins:
            kinesin: to +
            dynein: to -
        determining positions of organelles
        segregation of chromosomes during mitosis

    Tubulin heterodimers & MTs
        in new filaments: GTP bound to [beta]
        in old filaments: GDP bound to [beta]

        microtubule: 13 parallel filaments => hollow tube (30nm diameter)

Assembly/disassembly of cytoskeleton (focused on F-actin and MT)

Why study cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly?
    T cell reorganizes its cytoskel. (MT and actin) to form an immunological
        synapse with APC (antigen-presenting cell)
    T cell's Golgi brought to this synapse (right next to cell)
        - secretory process happens very rapidly - release cytokines/lytic granules(?)

[movie: cytotoxic T-cells lyse their targets]
[movie: the "T cell synapse"]
    synapse - outer (adhesion ring) - inside: secretory zone and ###


intrinsic factors controlling cytoskeletal dynamics
    cytoskeleton assembly/disassembly - "in-vitro" polymerization

    lag phase (nucleation) -> growth phase -> equilib./s.s. phase

nucleation is rate-limiting in F-actin formation
    must forma seed before elongation takes place

    why rate-limiting?
        F-actin: the prob. of forming a trimer is much lower than that of forming a dimer
        
        MT: the # of tubulin subunits required is different but the principle is the same

however, the nucl. phase only affects the kinetics of polymerization, not the s.s. level

the growth phase corresponds to filament elongation
    more going on than there are coming off

nucl., elongation, & s.s.
    elongation: on rate > off rate

elongation phase: on rate and off rate
    K_on - rate constant for the addition of a subunit to the filament end
    K_off - rate constant for the removal of a subunit from the filament end
    C - free subunit conc.

    on rate = K_on * C
    off rate = K_off

the equilib. phase corresponds to the s.s.
    on rate = off rate

the s.s. phase and critical conc. (Cc)
    Cc is the conc. of free subunits at which:
        on rate = off rate
        K_on * Cc = K_off

    if C > Cc, on rate > off rate =>   polymerization is favored
    if C < Cc, on rate < off rate => depolymerization is favored
