The compounding factor: the two ends of F-actin or MTs are not equivalent

Reason 2: ATP or GTP hydrolysis differentially modifies the behaviors of two ends

after a subunit is added to a filament, its ATP (for actin) or GTP (for tubulin)
will eventually be hydrolyzed due to a conformational change

...leads to 2 conseq.

1) D form has a lower affinity; thus, a higher Cc (more conc. needed to keep it together)
2) the T form is more likely to be found at (+) end; thus,
    Cc(+) is often less than Cc(-)

What are the implications?
    one implication: treadmilling
        condition: Cc(-) > G-actin conc. > Cc(+)

        net assembly at plus end
        net disass. at minus end

MT dynamics and cell migration
    alternating shrinkage & growth of MT's

    microtubules grow from centrosome

    [movie: MT dynamic instability]

    ER is pulled along by motor proteins which attach to MTs

another implication of dynamic instability ("catastrophe")
    rapid loss of filament occurs after removal of GTP or ATP cap

F-actin regulation

key points
    many cytoskel. regulators - no time in course to understand them all in detail

how does the extracellular environ. communicate through the cytoskel.?

IFs are more stable compared to F-actin and MT, but they are still dynamic.
    Phosphorylation of lamin (a nuclear IF) contributes to the breakdown of
    the nuclear envelope during mitosis, which is important for the segregation
    of replicated chromosomes
