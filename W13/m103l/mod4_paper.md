Introduction:

    The introduction as it stands now:
        Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) is a small hydrophilic molecule with
        antimicrobial properties at relatively low concentrations; it is used
        for this purpose in many hygiene and cosmetics products.  It has been
        shown that MIT exhibits neurotoxic effects in vitro, but no clinical
        evidence has been published for patient CNS or nerve damage, although
        this cannot be ruled out, considering the lack of research.  However,
        the tendency of MIT to cause dermatitis and allergic reactions in some
        individuals has been documented (###CITE).

        In this study, we examine the effects of MIT on PC-12 cells. PC-12
        cells are derived from a rat adrenal medulla tumor, and can
        differentiate to become very similar to sympathetic neurons: neurites
        and other neuron-like processes are extended from the cell body and
        synapses are formed. (###CITE)

        Previous work has revealed the mechanism by which methylisothiazolinone
        causes the death of neurons: certain soluble zinc-binding proteins rely
        on thiol groups for their function, and so the cytosolic Zn2+
        concentration increases when these thiol groups are oxidized by MIT.
        The high concentration of Zn2+ leads to a signal transduction cascade
        ultimately resulting in cell death (Du, et al., 2002).
        ###
        G-actin and tubulin are monomers of cytoskeletal components that (among
        other functions) allow neurites to be extended and provide their
        structural integrity.  In this study, we use a Western blot to compare
        the amounts of actin and tubulin produced in the presence and absence
        of NGF. ###
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    What is missing from the above (see lab manual)?

    PC-12 cells:
        used as a model for studying human neurons
            ###

        derived from rat pheochromocytomas
            ###

...methylisothiazolinone is hydrophilic and so does not penetrate well into the skin (###cite),

Results:
    Data:
        Part I (Neurite outgrowth):

        Part II (Western blot):
            neurite count for these cells

            % confluence

            no actin band; tubulin band at 30kD as well as 55kD but actual mol wt is 30kD

Discussion:

---
    Brief statement of what has been shown by the data:
        The data shows that dbcAMP has the largest effect on neurite development. ###

    Significance of the findings (longer):

        - interpret the data

        - examine significance of results (what do results mean w.r.t. to how cells
          normally function in whole organisms?)

        - are the results unexpected or surprising?
            
            - if so, what are possible explanations?

    Compare to other studies (make use of references)

    Any questions that arise from the results?

    Ideas for future experiments? DONE

    chambered cells (see jeff_data/PC-12_JKB_24well.pdf):
        effects of dbcAMP

        effects of NGF

        effects of EGF

        effects of MIT

    are the results significant? no
    why didn't we get the results we expected?
        chambered slides:
            ###
        -/+ NGF:
            possibly we gave the cells normal media instead of diff. media

        Western blot:
            why two tubulin bands?
            why no actin? possibly the ### (the anti-actin Ab) didn't work or was degraded
