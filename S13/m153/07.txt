Lecture 7

[20 min late]

Review:
    Anterior-posterior polarity of the nervous system:
        retinoic acid

    the notochord is secreting Shh

examples of adhesion molecules expressed on growth cones (all assoc.
intracellularly w/ cytoskel. elements)

two mechanisms or cell/growth cone navigation
    (we already covered 1)

    2. guidance by gradients of diffusable molecule

how does it all fit together?
    "as devel. proceeds, the growth cone preferences may change"

LN(laminin) spots
    guide-post spots that disappear after they are no longer needed
    but "just a correlation"
    "experimentally, you want to perturb the system, and see what happens"
    Result: laminin is necessary for neural crest migration

---
mix & match alpha & beta:
alpha1 beta1 is a receptor for collagen
alpha6 beta1 -> LN (laminin)
alpha4 beta1 -> fibronectin
alphaV beta3 -> vitronectin

these are transmembrane receptors
    ***bind ECM on the outside of the cell; when they do, causes assoc. w/ cytoskel. on inside

signaling molecules
    LN bound its integrin (alpha6 beta1) => activates FAK125 (a focal adhesion kinase) =>
        activates signaling cascade

integrins "integrate" the ECM and the cytoskel.
