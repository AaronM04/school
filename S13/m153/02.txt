Lecture 2

how to decide between whole animals, cultured tissues, and cultured cells?
    depends on the question you are trying to answer

how about trying to understand the mol. basis of dev. phenomena?
    localizing proteins of interest

    determining the functions of proteins of interest

immunofluorescence microscopy
    antigen-binding site - recognizes epitope (region of some foreign molecule)

---

what cells express my protein of interest (POI) and when in development?

build a plasmid:
    CMV - very strong promoter

    EYFP - a version of GFP

most of our proteins don't function as monomers

function-blocking Ab
    "if we are really lucky, we might get an Ab that binds right to an active site"

Slides: "Lectures 2-4"

fertilization:
    sperm & egg each contribute a haploid complement

differential gene expression:
    1.  asymmetric division: the starting cell isn't really homogeneous
    2.  symmetric division: sister cells become different as a result of influences
        acting on them after their birth

cell proliferation, cell specialization, cell interaction, cell movement

universal mechanism of animal devel.
    all species use similar proteins
        to define their specialized cells

        to define differences in btwn body regions

        to create the body's pattern

compare cerebellums in:
    normal mouse

    mouse lacking Engrailed-1

    mouse rescued by Drosophila Engrailed(!!!)

this works more often than not
the two Engrailed genes would be called homologs

sources of asymmetry:
    gray crescent

    point of sperm entry

induction

blastula
    "water balloon"
    epithelial layer of cells
        1-2 cells thick
        on the inside is a sheet of ECM

    fluid center
        blastocoel

gastrula
    "very important, but kind of complicated, step"
    3-layered structure
    different from one organism to the next
    complicated invagination event

    change in shell shape
    change in cell arrangements
    filopodial-ECM interactions

    epithelial cells at the bottom change shape and begin to invaginate, producing a broad,
    flat dome
        - mediated by actin filament changes

        cells that are part of the invagination pull themselves by extending
        filopodia to grab onto the ECM on the inside of the blastula to form
        the gastrula
