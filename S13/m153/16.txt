Review:
    start in entorhinal cortex; spread to amygdala and beyond

    if mutation in APP => autosomal dominant early onset Alzheimer's

    agents of toxicity are not the A[beta] plaques, but the oligomers

    the problem is not A[beta] generation, but A[beta] clearance:
        mediated by neprolysin and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)

        when anyone ages, the conc of these two enzymes go down
        it seems that in Alzheimer's patients, they go down faster

    Microtubules are dynamic polymers
        tau tends to slow down the shortening rates of MTs

    two classes of tau mutations that map w/ the FTDP-17 phenotype

How about risk factors for AD?
    age
    apolipoprotein E
        cholesterol/TG mechanism
    ...

ApoE3 is most common ###

how about oxidative damage?
    ROS: reactive oxygen species
    increase with age
    ROS can cross-link lots of cell's molecules
        disrupt their function
        make them more resistance to turnover

    in cell culture, anti-oxidants such as VitE can reduce A[beta]-mediated toxicity

currently avail. drugs for Alzheimer's disease
    most current drugs are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
    makes signals last longer by preventing neurotransmitter breakdown
    they don't help much...

Memantine: a diff. class of drug
    manufactured as Namenda

    recently approved in US

    acts on glutaminergic NMDA receptors
        excess Glu can cause neuronal cell death

    doesn't do much either...

How about prevention of Alzheimer's disease?
    NSAIDs
        neuro-inflammation is likely to be part of the Alzheimer's disease process

    June 2003
        2 NSAIDs (rofecoxib and naproxen) fail to show the rate of cognitive decline in mild
        to moderate Alzheimer's disease

    "statins" are drugs that reduce cholesterol levels
        UK study - 70% lower chance of getting Alzheimer's disease
        confirmed by a second study in the US; 60-73% reduced risk

        a possible rationale: lipid rafts

"in progress" strategies to combat Alzheimer's

update on AD "vaccine" ...it's not all bad news...
    background on vaccines

    but AD doesn't really have a pathogen

trying to develop a vaccine
    generate a mouse model that gets amyloid plaques
    focus on getting rid of plaques
    expt:
        inject mice w/ A[beta] to cause immune response

    data:
        mice get fewer and smaller amyloid plaques; impreved performance in memory tests

    early human testing of A[beta] injections led to a low but still unacceptable level
    of neuro-inflammation (can be life-threatening)
        halted trial

        but those who had the Ab's had slower cognitive decline

alternatives to consider to avoid neuro-inflammation
    1. don't inject entire A[beta]
    2. make A[beta] in cell culture (problem: need to do every 1-2 weeks for rest of life)
    3. lots of other possibilities

short A[beta] immunogens reduce cerebral...

several drugs that inhibit [beta]- or [gamma]-secretase are in testing right now; concerns
about side-effects

so where are we now?
    all 38 phase III clinical trials have failed

    question we should have asked earlier:
        when does Alzheimer's begin?

        we need non-invasive imaging tech:
            A[beta]-detecting brain scans (yellow is amyloid; red is lots of amyloid)
            (green is some amyloid)
            even 20 years before, you see some A[beta]

        so maybe problem is that it is too late when they are showing symptoms

pathological changes occur years before symptoms appear

perhaps our candidate drugs are all failing because they are being administered far
too late

need to think about prevention differently
    how to proceed?

    family in rural Columbia w/ mutant presenilin gene (dominant inheritance)

the plan:
    100 mutation carriers get crenezumab (anti-A[beta] Ab's) every two weeks
    100 mutation carriers will receive placebo injections every two weeks
    100 non-mutation carriers will receive placebo injections every two weeks:
        because ppl don't want to know if they have gene
    double-blind format
    5 yr, $100M study funded by NIH and Genentech
    starts summer 2013!
    
    problem:
        only 0.1% of Ab's cross BBB

epothilone D
    small molecule that can cross BBB and stabilize MTs

    transgenic PS19 mice that express P301S tau mutant at high levels

    phenotype:
        hyper(P) of tau
        neurodegeneration
        ...

can epothilone D compensate for tau loss of function in young PS19 mice?
    MT density and axonal integrity improved
    reduced cognitive losses

can epothilone D help older mice that already have tau aggregates?
    improved axonal transport and cognitive performance

---
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a very strong risk factor for AD
    cholesterol/triglyceride regulation
    ApoE2/3/4 - 4 is the bad one

    ApoE normally promotes A[beta] degradation

    Gary Landreth's lab at CWRU
        "my pal" -Dr. Feinstein

    in they could increase ApoE levels in cells, that should degrade A[beta] faster

What does Gary and his lab###

Cramer et al., 2012 Science

What does Gary need to test his hypothesis?

how does bexarotene induce ApoE expr.?
    binds to RXR => promote ApoE transcription

so... what happened?
    1. start w/ 2 month old "AD mice" (no symptoms yet)
    2. treat w/ bexarotene and measure ApoE levels in brain

    actin is a loading control to know we loaded same amounts of protein

    increased signals for APCA1, APCG1, and ApoE

what about measuring A[beta] levels?
    A[beta] levels decline within 6 hours; down 25% in 24 hours
    A[beta] levels stay reduced for 72 hours from single treatment
    reduction in A[beta] levels was the result of increased degradation

what about A[beta] plaque levels?
    start w/ older mice - lots of plaques

    plaque levels decline, but not in all mouse models

how about behavior?
    1. start w/ "AD mice" who had forgotten to build a nest

    bexarotene - animals recover ability to build a nest!
        similar observations in Morris water maze test and fear conditioning test

how about treatment of old mice?
    soluble A[beta] levels decline and behavior/cognition improves
        but no significant reduction in A[beta] plaque levels

        conclusion: Plaques don't matter!

summary
    bexarotene induces a normal cellular mechanism that not only arrested the progression
    of "AD" in mice, it actually _reversed_ the biochemical and behavioral losses.

    at least 3 stages for neurons:
        alive
        sick (w/ AD symptoms)
        dead

    the sick ones are contributing to symptoms, but they can be healed

    bexarotene is already FDA approved as an anti-skin cancer agent, so it has already been
    shown to have an "acceptable" safety profile

translation into clinical trials (for bexarotene)
