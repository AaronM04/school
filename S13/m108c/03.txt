CO2 fixation
Calvin Cycle
    H2O -> O2

ADP + Pi -> ATP
NADP+ + H+ -> NADPH

RUBISCO - ribulose-1,5-bis(P) carboxylase/oxygenase
                            good thing      bad thing

                    bad, because it evolved in the absence of oxygen

ribulose-1,5-bis(P): CO(P)-C=O-COH-COH-CO(P)

RUBISCO catalyzes:
    ribulose-1,5-bis(P) + CO2 -> carboxyl on C2 --(+H2O)--> 2 x 3-phosphoglycerate

    we go from 5 C's to 6 C's (because of adding CO2)

happens in the stroma of the chloroplast

we zoom in on C2 and C3 of ribulose-1,5-bis(P):
    carbon-carbon bonds are hard to make
    R-C=O-COH-R'  coordinated w/ Mg2+ and carbamoyl-Lys241 (carbamoyl is R-NH=COO-)

    H on C3 gets plucked away => an enediolate (or enediole???): R-COH=COH-R'

    CO2 coordinated w/ Mg2+ comes in (makes the C partially positive)

    His takes a proton off of C3, causing electrons to be "pushed" onto the C of CO2

    second stage: hydrolysis to form two 3-phosphoglycerates

    RUBISCO is 3 or 4 cycles per second - extremely slow
        therefore, must be present in a high number of copies

    three rounds of this yields six 3-phosphoglycerates
        one goes to biosynthesis

        the remaining five go into the calvin cycle, ultimately regenerating
        ribulose-1,5-bis(P)

3 x ribulose-1,5-bis(P) + 3 CO2 -> 6 phosphoglycerates
    the 3-phosphoglycerates are too oxidized to do anything useful with them

    need to be reduced => consumes ATP -> get bisphosphoglycerate
    bisphosphoglycerate -> consumes NADPH -> glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

triose-(P)-isomerase => dihydroxyacetone-(P)
    one DHAP goes to biosynth.
    five DHAP's go to the calvin cycle

DHAP + G3P ---aldolase----> CO(P)-C=O-COH-COH-COH-CO(P) (fructose-1,6-bis(P))
                                                                (deltaG = -1.7 kJ/mol)

F1,6BP ----phosphatase---> F6P (huge and negative deltaG = -27.2 kJ/mol)

F6P + G3P ---transketolase---> erythrose-4-(P) + xylulose-5-(P)

transketolases:
    thiamine pyrophosphate (vitamin B1)

    (see TPP rxn in the book)
