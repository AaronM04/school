Lecture 19 - nitrogen waste (cont.)

mammals, terrestrial animals - urea
fishes, marine invertebrates - NH4
birds + reptiles - uric acid

purine catabolism
    nucleotide monophosphates + H2O -> ribose-5-(P) (or more phosphates) + purine base
    
    purine base can be absorbed by intestinal cells or broken down in liver (?)

    AMP + H2O -deaminase-> IMP + NH4    (basically the reverse of purine
                                         biosynth, but diff. enzymes)
    IMP + H2O -> ribose + hypoxanthine   (free base of inosine)
    hypoxanthine + H2O + O2 --xanthine-oxidase-> xanthine + H2O2

    GMP -> guanine + ribose
    guanine + H2O -> xanthine + NH4
    xanthine + H2O + O2 --xanthine-oxidase-> uric acid + H2O2
        in humans and other higher primates, uric acid is the waste product
        purine catabolism is the only time we excrete uric acid
    uric acid + 1/2 O2 + H2O --urate-oxidase-> alantoin + CO2 (opened up one ring)
        done by mammals other than primates; excrete alantoin, not uric acid
        alantoin is much more water soluble, so why do we make uric acid?
            result: gout
        animals that can't make vitamin C also can't make alantoin
        uric acid is a partial replacement for vitamin C - uric acid is an antioxidant
    alantoin + H2O -> alantoate - very water-soluble
        only in bony fishes
    alantoate + H2O -> 2 urea + glyoxylate
        amphibians and cartilagenous fishes
    urea + H2O -> 2 NH4 + CO2
        marine invertebrates & bacteria

purine scavenging
    adenine, guanine, or hypoxanthine  + PRPP -> AMP/GMP/IMP + PPi
    so we can scavenge purines from our diet, and we don't have to synth. them de novo

--
pyrimidine catabolism
    thymidine eventually metabolized to succinyl-CoA => citric acid cycle
    uracil and cytosine: excrete intermediates or turn into antioxidants

      dTMP -> thymidine + ribose
    (d)UMP -> uracil + ribose
    (d)CMP -> cytosine + ribose
    cytosine + H2O -> uracil + NH4
        uracil is actually the only one we scavenge
    uracil + ribose-1-(P) --uridine-phosphorylase -> uridine nucleoside (no phosphate) + Pi
    uridine nucleoside + ATP --uridine-kinase-> UMP + ADP
        recall: 5-fluorouracil from last lecture
            5-fluorouracil -> 5-f-uridine nucleoside -> 5-f-UMP -> 5-f-UDP -> 5-f-dUDP ->
            5-f-dUTP -> 5-f-dUMP => kills thymidilate synthase dead! x_x

    thymine is never scavenged
    [see paper]

biochemistry of transcription
    1. identify promoters
    2. melt dsDNA -> ssDNA
    3. catalysis
    4. translocation along DNA

    dsDNA w/ promoter -  we need to start transcription at one base out of millions!

    dsDNA -> disassociate dsDNA; reveal ssDNA template (takes energy)
        affects coiling on either side
