Lecture 10 - cholesterol (cont.)

### + NADPH --HMG-CoA reductase--> mevalonate + NADP+ --(3 ATP used)--> ### + CO2 + Pi

### -> isopentyl pyrophosphate <-> dimethylallyl pyrophosphate

head-to-tail condensation

2 isopentyl pyrophosphate -> -> geranyl pyrophosphate (10C)

another 5-carbon unit replaces the PPi in geranyl pyrophosphate-> farnasyl pyrophosphate (15C)

2 farnasyl pyrophosphate ---(head-to-head)--> ???

??? => 3-carbon ring! => PPi leaves, have carbocation => carbocation moves => NADPH reduces
    "and that's how the head-to-head condensation works"

now we have squalene; just a few bonds away from cholesterol

squalene + O2 + NADPH -> H2O + NADP+ + an epoxide   (condensation, NOT oxidation!)

the epoxide -> many carbocations!!! "carbocation cascade" -> pre-sterol cation
    (all of the preceding reactions are the same across plants, animals, and fungi)


pre-sterol cation -> -> -> -> -> stigmasterol   (plants)
pre-sterol cation -> -> -> -> -> cholesterol    (animals)
    (12 NADPH -> 12 NADP+)
pre-sterol cation -> -> -> -> -> ergosterol     (fungi)

Accounting:
    18 Acetyl-CoA + 12 NADPH -> -> -> 12 NADP+ + 6 mevalonate
    6 mevalonate + 18 ATP -> -> -> 18 ADP + 6 isopentyl-PPi + 6 CO2
    4 isopentyl-PPi -> 2 geranyl-PPi + 2 isopentyl-PPi -> 2 farnesyl-PPi

    2 farnesyl-PPi + NADPH -> 1 squalene + NADP+ + 2 PPi

    1 squalene + NADPH + O2 -> pre-sterol cation + NADP+ + H2O

    pre-sterol cation + 12 NADPH -> -> -> -> cholesterol + 12 NADP+
    -----------
    one cholesterol costs 18 ATPs + 26 NADPHs => costs alot
    therefore, very heavily regulated (at formation of mevalonate)

dolichol - flips sugar back and forth between sides of ER membrane (cytoplasm->lumen)

---
regulation of cholesterol pathway:

HMG-CoA + NADPH --HMG-CoA reductase--> NADP+ + mevalonate

insulin causes dephosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase, and glucagon causes phosphorylation

cholesterol is made on the surface of the ER
    HMG-CoA reductase is tethered to cytosolic side of ER membrane

"not in book!!! new - 2011"
    Insig-1 gene turned on by insulin - binds cholesterol
    when binds cholesterol, also binds HMG-CoA reductase
    leads to ubiquination of HMG-CoA reductase => HMG-CoA reductase gets degraded
    result: "if we already have cholesterol, we don't make more"

    SREBP and SCAP
        also mediated by Insig-1
        transcriptional regulators of cholesterol biosynthesis
        if no cholesterol, SCAP cuts SREBP, releasing a cytoplasmic domain of SREBP
        SREBP fragment goes into nucleus, and turns on cholesterol synth transcription

        when there is cholesterol, SCAP and SREBP bind tightly to each other

cholesterol permits LDL-mediated endocytosis
