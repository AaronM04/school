Agenda:
    photosynthesis
    lipids/membranes
    nitrogen
    amino/nucleic acids
    transcription/translation

Photosynthesis:
    light reactions
        (absorption - light-harvesting complexes)
            an exciton is formed
            they get shuffled around until they reach a reaction site

        a proton-motive force is established (by pumping H+)
            -> ATP

        this is used to create reducing power
            -> NADPH

Absorbance
    E_photon = h*c/lambda
        h - Planck's constant
        c - speed of light
        lambda - wavelength

    lambda_blue ~ 450nm
    lambda_red  ~ 700nm

chromophores
    have conjugated pi systems - allow excited electrons to be delocalized
        you end up with a hole and an electron - they want to come together
        because of opposite charges
            the energy of the exciton prevents them from coming together

            the job of the chromophore is to stabilize the separation of
            the electron-hole pair

LHCs (light harvesting complexes)
    - increased surface area
    - transfer energy to reaction center

    the exciton may be far away from the rxn center - exciton transfer
        no loss of energy in this process - 100% efficient

    exciton only stable for ~200ps - not enough time for a random walk to the rxn center

    electrons in the chromophores are in a coherent state
        - all the paths are taken simultaneously - quantum random walk

electron transport

in rxn center: "special pair" of chlorophyll
    - an ETC is connected to this (electron carriers sitting nearby)

    likelihood of electron transport:
        delta G of e- transport = z*F*(E0_end - E0_initial)

    electrons want to move from an electronegative environment to an electropositive environ.
    
    going from rxn center (+1.0V) to pheophytin (-0.9V) is uphill; this happens because of
    the energy from the exciton (which takes us from +1.0V to -1.0V)

        delta G = (-1)(96.5 kJ/(V*mol))*(-0.9V - -1.0V)
                = -9.7 kJ/mol

Green plants
    RC -> pheophytin -> Qa(immobile) -> Qb(mobile) -> Cyt b6f -> PS I
                            ("exactly like the Q cycle")

            the above is PS II (photosystem 2)

Green plants have a z-scheme in PS I:
    ETC hooked up in series with a way to reduce NADP+ to NADPH

PS I: A0(iron-sulfur proteins) -> ferridoxin -> Fd-NADPH+ oxidoreductase

proton motive force powers the f1f0 ATPase (as in oxidative phosphorylation)
