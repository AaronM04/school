fatty acid biosynth

palmitate (hexadecanoic acid)

put together from acetyl-CoA

acetyl-CoA can lead to:
    TCA
    FAs
    cholesterol

pyruvate ---PDH+TPP--> acetyl-CoA + CO2

acetyl-CoA + CO2 --acetyl-CoA carboxylase---> malonyl CoA      (first committed step)
    consumes ATP
    makes a C-C bond! not very favorable without coupling to ATP hydrolysis
    biotin cofactor

CO2 has two solution forms:
    stay as gas, or
    CO2 + OH- ---> CO3H-

CO3H- takes a (P) from ATP -> carbonyl phosphate + ADP
biotin attaches to the C of carbonyl phosphate, and Pi leaves
biotin flips around to a separate active site within the enzyme

it's believed that a proton in the methyl of acetyl-CoA gets abstracted, resulting in
a carbanion, which attacks the C newly attached to biotin; biotin comes off

-----
fatty acid synthase
    in bacteria, it's a complex of proteins w/ 7 activities
    in humans, it's one protein (the above strung together)

has a part that looks like CoA (thiol groups)
    malonyl gets transferred onto these, forming thioester bonds
    the COO- is a good leaving group; acetyl CoA gets plucked off the "arm"
    result: a C-C bond is formed
    CO2 leaves (no net loss of CO2 because it came in earlier)

NADPH reduces the ketone, resulting in an -OH
dehydration => we get a C=C double bond
another reduction => we have a single bond

next, transferase step:
    "re-prime the system"
    the chain gets moved onto the other thiol, and the cycle repeats

--------------
humans -> make FAs when well-fed
plant -> light
bacteria -> cell cycle

the enzyme you should regulate is acetyl-CoA carboxylase, because:
    reversible (consumes ATP)
    first dedicated step

plant acetyl-CoA carboxylase regulated by high pH and high Mg2+
human acetyl-CoA carboxylase regulated by signal transduction from glucagon/epinephrine
    when enzyme is phosphorylated, it is off

"insulin involvement is more complicated"

acetyl-CoA is made in the mitochondria, but FA synth occurs in cytoplasm
    shuttling pathway:
        in mito:
            acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate -> citrate + CoA
            citrate goes into cytoplasm

        cytoplasm:
            citrate + ATP ---citrate-lyase--> oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA + ADP

            oxaloacetate + NADH -> malate + NAD+, and malate goes back, or:
            malate + NADP+ -> pyruvate + CO2 + NADPH, and pyruvate goes back!

        back in mitochondrion:
            malate + NAD+ -> oxaloacetate + NADH, or:
            pyruvate + ATP + CO2 -> oxaloacetate + ADP

        shuttling system is ATP powered, so we only want to run it when well-fed

epinephrine regulates acetyl-CoA->malonyl-CoA (as discussed above), but
insulin regulates citrate lyase (citrate->oxaloacetate) in the shuttling system

allosteric regulation:
    citrate activates acetyl-CoA -> malonyl-CoA, and FAs inhibit this

-------------------
need membrane fluidity, so we need a cis double bind

palmitate -> cis delta-9 hexadecanoic acid

instead of using NAD+, we use a mixed function oxidase!
    reduce O2 to water
    O2 takes 4e- but we're only getting 2e-!
    solution: also use NADPH: get 2e- to make O2 happy
