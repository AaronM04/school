Lecture 21 - transcription

identify promoter
form "open complex"
polymerize
translocate
terminate

Review:
    Rho goes up the mRNA to the butt of the polymerase => RNAP forms closed complex
    (Rho finds a "RUT" site on the mRNA)

Rho-independent termination "is a 25 year old model"
    nobody's been able to get it to crystallize

    what they think is that the stem-loop acts like a lever to pry off the transcript
    from the DNA strand (easier because of many U=A base pairs)
    they speculate that the stem-loop forms inside the RNAP cavity, jamming it up

identify promoter
    regulation

    transcriptional activator proteins bind just upstream of the -35 promoter element
        increases affinity of RNAP for this stretch of DNA => increase transcription

    repressor proteins
        prevent RNAP from binding

        repressors can also change shape of DNA => make a loop to hide the promoters in

Lac repressor
    controls genes that digest lactose

    can't be all-on or all-off; otherwise, we wouldn't get any lactose metabolized (????)

Trp biosynthesis
    "we want reg. to be opposite"

    we don't want to make any tryptophan if we have plenty

    when we run out of it, repressor falls off

regulation specific to prokaryotes: sigma factors
    useful for things where the environment rapidly changes
    E coli can live from 16 C to 48 C
        protein expr profile is entirely different! cold shock and heat shock sigma factors

    sigma factors are good for when you have a lot of genes to be regulated

sigma_H (heat-shock sigma factor) => Hsp70 chaperone

"normal" (37C) => sigma_H bound to DnaK
"heat shock" >=42C:
    competition at DnaK active site between sigma_H and unfolded proteins
    sigma_H turns on heat-shock genes

---
sigma_E - "a tale of two research groups"
group 1: studying sigma factor itself: clone & over-expr to see what genes come on:
    periplasmic proteases and chaperones
    factors necessary to assemble outer membrane

    RseA - regulator of sigma_E A; transmemb. protein of inner membrane
        "binds sigma_E (on cytoplasmic side) and doesn't let it go"

        RseA gene gone => sigma_E activated
    

group 2: DegS - no activity in vitro, wtf!
    "well, maybe it's a site-specific protease"
    take random peptide library, and a column w/ DegS affixed
    find what peptides stick to DegS (comes off w/ acid wash)
        XXYXF-(C term)
        the peptide was not degraded, though

    temperature-sensitive plasmid => raise temp => plasmid goes away
    do any cells live if we get rid of DegS? only if you also have a loss of RseA

    combine DegS and RseA in test tube and nothing happens
        then, add to these an XXYXF peptide => RseA gets cut
        proteins ending in XXYXF: Omp{X,C,A,F}; outer memb. proteins

"we get transcription of all these genes involved in outer memb. assembly"

stress response(outer memb. proteins screwed up) => protease activity => sigma_E activated

---
Eukaryotic transcription

-30: TATA box (TA-rich seq)

histones also involved in transcriptional regulation

TATA box is bound by either TPB or TF(II)A => recruit TF(II)B
    "grossly oversimplified" lol
    recruits RNAP-TFIIF

need to open up DNA
TF(II)E and TF(II)H - "checkpoint protein"
    TF(II)H is a helicase

"open complex"
    slow initiation
    the stability is sensed by the helicase:
        mRNA exiting => helicase phosphorylates C-term tail of RNA Pol => elongation phase!

elongation ~3600 bp/min
