Lecture 8

*** midterm through this Friday (4/19)
*** do all the problem sets!

16-carbon --elongases--> 18-carbon
elongases in ER; mostly for FAs destined for cytoplasm

triacylglycerol:
    3 acyl chains attached to a glycerol

can't take a TAG into the cell - too hydrophobic (will get stuck in plasma membrane)
biosalts in intestine - detergent - makes TAGs soluble
pancreatic lipase catalyzes hydrolysis of the 1 and 3 acyl chains, leaving only the 2 chain

in the intestinal cells, there are transporters for monoacylglycerol and FA
    inside the cell, the TAGs are reassembled using ATP
    packaged together into a chylomicron and exocytosed into the blood
    "after you eat In N Out, your blood will be cloudy with chylomicrons"

when the chylomicrons are actually used for energy, lipases cut off one FA at a time

liver cells can endocytose the chylomicrons; repackaged as lipoproteins

ways of making glycerol-3-(P):
    glycerol via glycerol kinase
    from DHAP (using NADPH)
    (???) from fatty acids (but need them hooked up to CoA)

it uses up a lot of ATP to hook up an FA to CoA
    FA + ATP -> adenosine-(P)-C=O-tail + PPi   (AMP-FA)
    AMP-FA + CoA-SH -> CoA-FA + AMP

    CoA-SH + FA -> CoA-FA  deltaG = +31 kJ/mol (very unfavorable due to less soluble product)
    ATP -> AMP + PPi   deltaG = -45.6 kJ/mol

    combining the two leaves something that is only slightly downhill, but
    pyrophosphatase helps a lot: PPi -> 2 Pi (removes product of above rxn)

3-(P)-glycerol + CoA-FA -> monoacylphosphoglycerol + CoA-SH
monoacylphosphoglycerol + CoA-FA -> diacylphosphoglycerol + CoA-SH
diacylphosphoglycerol -> diacylglycerol + Pi    ("I never really understood this" lolz)
diacylglycerol + CoA-FA -> triacylglycerol + CoA-SH

we regulate the production of glycerol-3-(P), surprisingly!

blood:
    has chylomicrons
adipose tissue:
    fat is stored
    has receptors on cell surface with lipase activity
        cut off individual FAs from the chylomicrons
        the FAs get transported in
        the TAGs get reassembled, and packed into lipid droplets

    when well-fed:
        pyruvate -> -> ---PEP carboxylase(regulated step)--> 3-(P)-glycerol
        promotes assembly of TAGs

    when not well-fed:
        TAGs get pulled out of lipid droplets
        lipases cause FAs to be released
        low PEP carboxylase activity, therefore low 3-(P)-glycerol => inhibit TAG assembly
        FAs get released into blood (bound to proteins at hydrophobic tails)

    the amount of FAs in the adipocyte determine whether they get released into blood
    and this amount is dependent on the rate of TAG assembly

the liver is another place where TAGs are made
    centers around gluconeogenesis

    endocytoses chylomicrons, or takes free FAs from blood
    if 3-(P)-glycerol is around, assembles TAGs
    TAGs get assembled into lipoproteins, which get endocytosed

    if starving:
        PEPCK activity is high (regulated by glucocorticoids) => we want fat in the blood
        TAG assembly is promoted (the opposite of in adipocytes)
    
    the lipoproteins also contain cholesterol, which is why liver doesn't just release FAs

synthesis of glycerophospholipids for membranes
    start off with some precursors as TAG

    diacylphosphoglycerol -> diacylglycerol + Pi
        DAG is not a good membrane lipid because head is not very hydrophilic
        need to attach a head group

    in Lehninger: strategy 1 & 2

    strategy 1 (both prokaryotes & eukaryotes):
        activate the oxygen in the -OH to react w/ head group
        CTP is used
        DAG + CTP -> CDP-lipid + Pi   (CDP is a very good leaving group)
        head group has an -OH, which attacks one (P) of the CDP => CMP leaves
        end up with HG-(P)-DAG

    strategy 2 (only eukaryotes; sorry, prokaryotes!):
        head-OH + CTP -> cyt-(P)-(P)-HG + Pi

        DAH-OH + cyt-(P)-(P)-HG -> HG-(P)-DAG + CMP

    strategy 3 ("strategy X" lol) - involves neighboring lipid; important for sphingolipids

    why not use FAs in membrane?
        they don't assemble in the right shape (we want planar)
        head group is a bit wider than tail, so they add curvature - BAD - form micelles

        this is also why FAs need to be protein-bound in the blood
        free FAs can lyse cells by destabilizing membranes!

----
sphingolipids

not based on glycerol at all
"so important - neuron function; cell-cell recognition"

CoA-FA(palmitate,C-16) + serine -> sphinganine
"chemistry is almost exactly like FA elongation"
serine carboxylic C attacks palmitate's ester C, and CoA leaves

sphinganine + NADPH -> ??? + NADP+

then we used mixed-function oxidase: get sphingosine (has C=C double bond)

the NH3 attacks another palmitate, creating an amide linkage

sphingosines get their head groups by stealing ("strategy X")!
but they can also have oligosaccharides on them:
    UDP-conj. sugar attacks phosphate bond => sugar attached to sphingolipid
        (sugar moieties responsible for ABO blood types)
