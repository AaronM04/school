Lecture 22 - Eukaryotic transcription (cont.)

TF(II)H burns ATP to open up the DNA; also regulates entry into elongation phase:
    if it detects RNA coming out, phosphorylates C-term tail of RNA Pol

because eukaryotes have a nucleus, there is no translation going on around RNA Pol
    allows making sure that the mRNA is okay before translation starts
    (in prokaryotes, however, translation happens concurrently w/ transcription)

"cytoplasm of any cell is chock full of RNAses" (both eukaryotes & prokaryotes)
    "chew up unstructured RNA"
    reasons: many RNA-dependent viruses, also want rapid mRNA turnover
    how to protect mRNA from degradation?
        5' capping (happens as soon as 5' end pops out)
        
        mediated by CBC (which sits at C-term end of RNA Pol)

capping:
    happens at either A or G base
    guanylyl transferase links GTP to the head A/G of the RNA in a "really unique linkage":
        has 3 phosphates in a row and is 5' to 5'
    also methylation of the guanidine base:
        methyl transfer from SAM (S-adenosyl methionine) (product is homocysteine adenylate)

splicing

mostly (80% of the time) co-transcriptional

start with exon-intron and intron-exon junctions
    you have sequences at both these places for recognition
    AGGUAGGU and AG-GU, respectively

also UACUAAC sequence inside intron
    the last A is skipped by the snRNP recognizer (see below)

snRNPs used to recognize these patterns by base-pairing interactions
    U1 - exon-intron junction (5' splice site)
    U2 - internal intron sequence (nucleophile; 2' OH of internal A)

psi = pseudo-uridine
    base-pairs with either A or G
    common in tRNA

after U1 and U2 assemble, mRNA shape changes
    U1 and U2 are closer together with RNA looping out
    
    U4 and U6 come together as a complex inside the loop, causing it to form (and U5)
        U4 prevents catalysis ("checkpoint protein")
        U6 does the actual catalysis
    "at some point we gotta ditch U4"
        goes away after everything checks out

form a lariat structure:
    exon-intron junction: G-G (5' cut site in between these bases)
    AAC at end of U2-binding site inside intron: un-base-paired A (the middle one):
        flips around to form a bulge
        the 2' OH of this A attacks the phosphate linking G and G of exon-intron junction
        we end up with a 2' to 5' phosphate linkage

finally, the two exons are stitched together:
    the 3' OH of the first exon G attacks the second G of AG-GU at start of second exon

    lariat structure gets degraded

alternative splicing
    can skip over exons
