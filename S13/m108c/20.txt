Lecture 20 - prokaryotic transcription

identify start site
unmask DNA template
polymerization (template-dependent)
translocation (along DNA)

*** final - nitrogen waste to end of course

RNA Polymerase (RNAP)
    beta & beta prime subunits - contains active site
    beta - channels for DNA / nascent RNA
    alpha * 2 - stabilize RNAP complex
        non-specific DNA affinity
    omega - chaperone/stabilizes complex

    only prokaryotes:
        sigma factor - identify promoters
            help form open complex

alpha subunits are "dangling domains" off the beta/beta'
    affinity for DNA - associate non-specifically w/ DNA

sigma2 at head
sigma3 in the middle
sigma4 toward the end, near alpha*2

sigma2 and sigma3 help identify the "minus ten" elements (10bp behind where we start)
    the first base to be copied is called +1 - promoter elements just upstream (negative)

    ~10.5bp per turn in DNA helix
        therefore, the "minus 10" is on same face of DNA helix as +1

    TATAAT promoter - for genes we need on all the time (ribosomal promoters, etc.)

sigma4 recognizes "minus 35" element - also on same face of DNA helix
    TTGACA

can't have too high affinity for these DNA sequences, or else RNAP will just be stuck there
    therefore, two low affinity sites:
        alpha (non-specific)
        sigma (specific)

need to rip H-bonds apart
    "prokaryotes have a cool way of doing this, not accessible to eukaryotes"

    sigma2 helps melt the DNA; get unpaired bases
        called the "open complex"

    surprisingly, the delta G for this melting is close to 0! wtf?
        in prokaryotes, there are ATP-dependent gyrases that force negative supercoiling
        extreme unwinding of the DNA - dramatically lowers energy necessary to melt DNA

somehow, DNA is "shoved inside" the polymerase

regions near start site are usually AT-rich - easier to break open

need NTPs in (there's a channel to allow this)
    base-pairing with the +1 residue stabilizes this until polymerization

polymerization:
    RNA polymerase doesn't need a primer for polymerization, unlike DNA polymerases

    get a PPi leaving group

    deltaG is "-40ish" (PPi + H2O -> 2 Pi is -18kJ/mol)

    ~3600 bp/min = ~60 bp/sec!

when we only have between 1 and 4 nt's in active site, we get "aborted initiation"
    the NTs can just fall off and diffuse out, and we have to start over
    at first, there is no translocation
    once we get 10 nt's, we're really stable; elongation phase starts!

elongation phase:
    "people don't know how this starts either"
    whole thing lurches ahead about 10 bases, and sigma factors are ejected
    NusA - prevents backtracking
    all of the energy for translocation comes from the polymerization reaction
        ~10 piconewtons - "like a bulldozer"

translation ~1200 AA/min (one third of 3600! mRNA used at same rate it is synthesized)

how do you stop this thing?
    mimick the "aborted initiation" - get mRNA out of the active site:
        rho-dependent termination
            rho is a multimeric helicase, but doesn't unwind things
            burns ATP to translocate 5'-3'
            goes 2-3x as fast as RNAP - catches up and pulls the mRNA out
            Rho hops on at RUT (rho-utilization) sites on RNA

        rho-independent termination
            secondary structure of RNA - GC-rich stem of stem-loop ~16bp
            following the stem-loop is 8-10 U's
            acts like a pry bar
