Lecture 6 - lipids

lipids = insoluble in water because they are hydrophobic
    many different structures, however

hydrogen bonds are what keep H2O a liquid and not a gas at r.t.

electronegative potential (physics)
    deltaG = n*F(E1-E2)

electronegativity (chemistry)
    an atom's affinity for e-

hydrophobic - cannot form H-bonds or ionic bonds w/ water

fatty acids:
    the carboxylic head can interact with water
    the tail cannot form H-bonds w/ water
    if we add a FA to water, it will disrupt existing H-bonds
        water will form H-bonds with itself tangential to the FA interface

        has surface tension; looks like an air-water interface! - hydrophobic effect

hydrophobic effect
    a conformation that minimizes disruption of H-bonds

    strength is proportional to hydrophobic surface area

a long-chain FA has more hydrophobic surface area than a shorter chain FA
    to see this, use a partitioning experiment: H2O over chloroform; where is the molecule?

in the absence of water, the only type of interaction is Van der Waals forces - very weak

    proportional to surface area

Tm = transition temp. from solid to liquid

6 carbon FA: Tm = -3.7C
8 carbon FA: Tm = 16.7C   <-- more surface area, stronger v.d.W forces

membranes

properties:
    compartmentalization
        hydrophobic effect
    fluid state
        van der Waals
        Tm

if you have enough carbons to have good compartmentalization, your membrane is
a solid => NOT GOOD; the solution is to have a kink - cis double bond

cis double bonds
    change the shape of FAs
    no effect on hydrophobicity
    lower Tm

lipids:
    membranes
    signaling molecules
    storage

TAGs
    form lipid droplets in water
    this is why we store our energy as fat

    "we would have to be sedentary to store our energy as sugars instead of fats; too much
    water needed to hydrate; fat is what allows animals to be locomotive"

membranes -> glycerophospholipids

(head group)-O-(P)-O-C1-C2-C3
C1&2-O-C=O-hydrocarbon tail
C2's tail has a cis double bond "kink" in it

plasmalogen
    has an ether-linked alkEne instead of ester: C3-O-C=C-tail

pre-platelet activating factor
    has an ether-linked alkAne instead of ester: C3-O-C-tail

    phospholipase A2 cuts off the C2 tail, causing molecule to be more soluble
    (becomes platelet activating factor); can diffuse out of the membrane a
    short distance, causing platelets to start clotting

cholesterol
    lets you fine-tune membrane fluidity
    precursor to many signaling molecules

sphingolipids
    amide linkage
    head group - can be oligosaccharides
    made by eukaryotes ("and even some sneaky bacteria")
    used for cell-cell recognition
        self-nonself
        ABO blood groups
        neuron firing
