Lecture 9 - eicosanoids

*** midterm through today

prostaglandins and thromboxanes:

arachidonic acid - we can't completely synthesize it (because of 11 and 14 double bonds)
    humans can only go up to the #9 carbon
    plants do 11 and 14 for us

arachidonic acid converted to:
    prostaglandins/thromboxanes
    leukotrienes

arachidonic acid ---Cox--> PGH2 (prostaglandin H2)

PGH2 -> various signaling molecules depending on the cell type

peripheral neural cell:
    --PLA2--> arachidonic acid --Cox-2-> PGH2 -> PGE2 (the actual signaling molecule)
                                                    hyperalgesia, fever

gastric epithelium:
    --PLA2--> arachidonic acid (AA) --Cox-1-> PGH2 -> PGE2
                                                        decrease gastric acid production,
                                                        increase mucus production

    replacement for aspirin that doesn't cause upset stomach:
        direct Cox-2 inhibitor: Vioxx, but problems such as heart disease

vascular endothelium:
    --PLA2--> AA --Cox-2-> PGH2 -> PGI2
                                    in the absence of injury, inhibition of platelet
                                    aggregation; also, vasodilation; "cardioprotective"

platelet:
    --PLA2--> AA --Cox-1-> PGH2 -> TXA2
                                    signal that we've been injured; promote aggregation
                                    of platelets; promote vasoconstriction

aspirin inhibits both Cox-1 and Cox-2
    how can we have a cardioprotective effect when both are inhibited?

    aspirin is a suicide inhibitor - destroys Cox-1 and platelets are not full cells
    so they can't make any more

------
leukotrienes:

arachidonic acid --lipoxygenase--> HPETE: has hydroperoxy group!

    HPETE used to make many different things

LTD4
    overproduced in people w/ asthma

---
anandamides

lecithin: arachidonic acid attached to C2 carbon

lecithin + some phospholipid w/ ethanolamine head group??? -> NAPE

NAPE -> anandamide

cannabinoid receptors:
    feeding behavior
    perception

---
cholesterol

almost no dedicated steps

2 * acetyl-CoA <--thiolase--> CoA-S-C=O-C-C=O-CH3 (acetoacetyl-CoA) + CoA

acetoacetyl-CoA + CoA with carbanion?!? --HMG-CoA synthase--> ??? --HMG-CoA synthase-> HMG-CoA
 + CoA

HMG-CoA + 2 NADPH --HMG-CoA reductase->  mevalonate + 2 NADP+ + CoA

mevalonate + 3 ATPs --> isopentyl pyrophosphate + 3 ADPs -> ### + Pi + CO2
