Lecture 14 - nitrogen assimilation

huge source of nitrogen on earth (N2 gas), but most organisms can't use it because of
triple bond

plants
    absorb NH4 or NO3 through roots
    or symbiotic relationship w/ bacteria

bacteria
    assimilate NH4
    start or end e- flow
    fix N2 -> 2 NH4 (symbiosis w/ plants)

heterotrophs (e.g., humans)
    eat nitrogen - glucosamine, AAs, nucleotides
    problem: excretion of nitrogen waste

Nitrosamonas - bacteria that take e- from N (NH4 or other forms)
    NH4 + O2 + 2e- -> NH2OH (hydroxylamine) + H2O -> NO2 + 2e- (feeds back into beginning)
                                                    plus another 2e- we can use,
                                                                (Q cyc=>reduces NAD+ to NADH)
                                                    plus 5 H+
        builds proton gradient

voltages:
    NH4     -0.1V
    NH2OH   +0.2V
    NO2     +0.4V
    Q cycle +0.5V

    problem: NAD+ is -0.33V
    solution: reverse electron transport - energy from proton-motive force is
        used to power the reduction of NAD+ to NADH

        another problem: where does the energy come from?
        soln: actually, only a small percentage of electrons used for this purpose; most
        of them go to another complex, where O2 is reduced to H2O (+0.8V)

    "all this is inefficient, so these bacteria grow really, really slowly"

    a second bacteria (nitrobacter) grows "in cahoots w/" Nitrosomonas that does NO2 -> NO3

another kind of bacteria, which we won't cover, takes NO3 to N2

rhizobia + cyanobacteria can fix N2, but activation energy is +932 kJ/mol
    N2 + 8 H + 8e- -> 2 NH4 + H2
        consumes 16 ATP
        -33 kJ/mol - favorable rxn, so why using ATP? activation energy!

    dinitrogenase - "shoves" e- onto N2; has molybdenum (Mo)
    dinitrogen reductase - gets high energy e- onto dinitrogenase, one electron at a time
        2 ATP's bound to dinitrogen reductase
        the hydrolysis of ATPs "lifts up" the e- to a high energy

    after dinitrogenase, we have H-N=N-H
        H-N=N-H + 2e- + 4 ATPs -> H2N-NH2 (hydrazine)  + 2e- + 4ATP -> 2 NH4

    because of this energy cost, no organism can fix nitrogen without being fed!
        requires symbiosis

    rhizobia recruited into root nodules in some plants (legumes)
        the outside of the nodules has heme to capture oxygen, keeping it out
        the bacteria get sugar from the plants
        the plants get NH4 from the bacteria

    cyanobacteria (in ocean):
        every 9 or so green cells, you'll see one clear cell
        the clear cell is a heterocyst - fixes N2
        differentiation, not symbiosis, since they have same genetics (from common ancestor)

---
how plants use nitrogen

if they get NO3, they just reduce it to NH4 before assimilation

glutamine synthetase
    -OOC-C-CH2-CH2-COO- + ATP -> glutamyl-(P) (phosphate on R group carboxyl)  + ADP
         |
        NH3
    
    phosphate is a good leaving group, so NH3 replaces it => you get glutamine

glutamate synthase (not a "synthetase" since doesn't use ATP)
    (reductive amidotransferase)

    alpha-ketoglutarate (like glutamate but ketone instead of amine group)

    alpha-ketoglutarate + glutamine -> 2 glutamates (one is used, one goes back into cycle)

why do we have glutamine synthetase? because ammonia needs to be detoxified

one big enzyme with two active sites and a channel between them:
    glutamine at one active site; alpha-ketoglutarate at the other
    cysteine near glutamine R group attacks the ketone C, releasing NH3
    the ammonia travels through the channel and attacks alpha-ketoglutarate => imine
    the imine gets reduced to glutamate using NADPH
    then, release glutamate from the Cys at the other site
