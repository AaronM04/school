Lecture 15

NH4 + glutamate + ATP ---glutamine-synthetase--> glutamine
    phosphate is a leaving group to allow ammonia to attach to glutamate

glutamine + alpha-ketoglutarate + NADPH --glutamate-synthase--> 2 glutamate

alpha-ketoglutarate + NH4 + ATP + NADPH --> glutamate

glutamine synthetase regulation
    responsive to biosynth. pathways that require N

    responsive to energy needs of the cell

    "one of the cooler, really efficient mechanisms of reg."
    "incredibly elaborate"

    allosteric inhibition
        sort of like a rheostat (multiple binding sites, variable levels of activity)

        glycine/alanine -> AAs - no nitrogen in their side chains

        AAs w/ nitrogen in side chains:
            histidine - 9 dedicated steps
            tryptophan - ~12 dedicated steps

        AMP - purine biosynth. (nucleotides)

        CTP - pyrimidine biosynth. (nucleotides)

        carbamoyl-(P) - required for synth. of arginine, and pyrimidines

        glucosamine-6-(P)

uridylyl transferase
    inhibited by Pi (a sign we don't have much ATP)
    inhibited by glutamine (a sign we have a lot of N)
    enhanced by ATP and alpha-ketoglutarate


P_II --UT--> P_II-UMP (conjugated to a tyrosine)
P_II <--UR-- P_II-UMP     (UR is not regulated, but slow)

Gln synth has active and inactive form based on adenylation on a Tyr

AT = adenylyl transferase
Gln synth active + ATP --P_II-AT--> Gln synth inactive (conj. to AMP)  + PPi

Gln synth inactive + H2O --P_II-UMP-AT--> Gln synth active  + AMP

so, AT has hydrolase activity OR transferase activity, depending on presence of UMP

high ATP and high alpha-ketoglutarate (low N)
    UT is active

    P_II -> P_II-UMP

    P_II-UMP binds AT, gives AT hydrolysis activity

    AMP is hydrolyzed from Gln synth

    activation of Gln synth

    UT is inhibited; we only have P_II activity => binds AT and promotes transferase activity
        P_II-AT adenylates Gln synth => inactivation of Gln synth

NR_I (inactive state)  <-- transcription factor
    gets phosphorylated by NR-II (a kinase), becomes active
    NR-I-(P) activates transcription of Gln synth

    but if NR-II is bound to P_II, it has phosphorylase activity, not kinase activity
        deactivates NR-I by dephosphorylation

    P_II-UMP cannot bind NR-II

putting it all together:
    P_II-UMP cannot bind NR-II
    NR-II is a kinase
    NR-I -> NR-I-(P)
    NR-I-(P) is active transcription factor
    increased expr. of Gln synth gene
    more nitrogen assimilated!

    -----OR-----
    P_II binds NR-II
    P_II-NR-II complex is a phosphorylase
    NR-I-(P) -> NR-I
    NR-I is inactive
    no transcription of Gln synth gene
    less nitrogen assimilated!
