Lecture 24 - prokaryotic translation

overview:
    initiation - 30S + IF1/3 scanning
    decoding - charging tRNAs (delivered by EF-tu)
             - mRNA decoding
    catalysis
    translocation
    termination

tRNA is given a squeeze; if base-paired incorrectly, pops out

rRNA A1492 and A1493 "talk to" the EF-tu - they flip from out to in => EF-tu's GTP hydrolized
    acts as a switch: "is there tRNA?"

catalysis:
    amide is very stable, making rxn irreversible
    tRNA is actually the leaving group for the amide formation

translocation:
    EF-G burns GTP (???)

---
termination:

a lot more is known about translational termination than transcriptional termination

there are no tRNAs that decode stop codons; instead, decoded by a protein factor:
    release factor (RF)
    in E coli, 2 RF's to decode 3 stop codons

    release factor binds at the A site - catalyzes hydrolysis of tRNA-polypeptide bond

    hydrolizes GTP of EF-G

    now, ribosome recycling factor (RRF) comes in
        "ppl don't really know what's going on here"
        disassociates ribosome into its two subunits

what happens when we start translating a message that has no stop codon?
    ribosome just goes to the 3' end of the mRNA
    release factors can't come in since there's no stop codon
    solution: tmRNA
        has both tRNA and mRNA properties!
        no anticodon loop, just a very long loop that acts like mRNA
        charged w/ Ala
        does peptidyl transfer, then moves to P site, then kicks off mRNA
            ???recruits RNAse???
            switches ribosome to its own reading frame, which has a stop codon

---
things that happen co-translationally to the nascent protein

peptide comes out an exit tunnel out of the large subunit (50S)

folding happens from N-terminal to C-terminal end; if it didn't, wouldn't fold correctly

factors influencing folding:
    ionic
    hydrogen bonds
    hydrophobic effect
        problem: when we first make a hydrophobic region, it is not happy sticking out into
        cytoplasm (could aggregate with things)

        solution: in prokaryotes, there's a trigger factor - assoc. w/ hydrophobic patches
        trigger factor released when its partner comes out (???)
        "there's a nice Nature paper about this"

secretory protein - destined either for membrane or periplasm
    transmemb. helices are very, very hydrophobic - too hydrophobic for trigger factor
    all secreted proteins have a signal peptide
        in prokaryotes, recognized by SecB
        SecB brings the whole translation complex to secretion machinery
            SecA (in the "machinery") recognizes signal peptide and burns ATP to get
            polypeptide chain into SecY (in the membrane)

            "the speed of translation matters"
                we want the translation to be slow

                if you put the signal peptide on a cytoplasmic protein, machinery gets stuck
                because the protein translated too fast

                ***in all secreted proteins, codon usage is different

                some tRNAs ("rare codons") are only present in a couple hundred copies

        in eukaryotes, something similar happens
            SRP is equivalent to prokaryotic SecB
            SRP does a "reach around" to stop translation :P
