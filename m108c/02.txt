Lecture 2

(z-scheme continued)

the special pair becomes positively charged - "bleached state" (chlorophyll looks white)
    - the electrons are recovered from water (oxygen evolving complex)
                - "this actually took a long time for life to figure out ~1e9 years"
                    (previously sulfur was used)

to convert NADP+ to NADPH requires 2e-

H2O -> O2 gives off 4e-
    if we do this 1e- at a time, we generate free radicals
    O2 evolving center counteracts this by stabilizing the intermediates:

        cubic calcium-manganese-oxide reaction center
            manganese can stably have multiple different oxidation states
            resonance structures!

Quinones can hold 2e- at a time
    take electrons from pheophytin (in PS II)
        => free radical form = semi-quinone
            (stabilized by resonance)
    takes another electron and becomes quinol

    deliver electrons to ferrodoxin, which has a disulfide bridge between two
    Cys (sep. by 2 AAs)
        the disulfide bond is reduced (and broken), resulting in two free thiols
            after this, an electron is given up, reforming the disulfide bridge

to deliver the electrons to NADP+ (which must be 2e- at a time), FAD is used
    FAD becomes a free radical (on a nitrogen) - a semiquinone

    gets another e- and becomes a hydroquinone (FADH2) => delivers 2e- to NADP+

--------

within the chloroplast are thylakoids
intermembrane space is called the stroma

very little is in the lumen of the thylakoid: water and protons

thylakoid membrane:
    ADP + Pi -> ATP
    NADP+ -> NADPH

dark reactions happen in the stroma

grana stacks
stromal lamella - "fingers" off the thylakoid(s)

the different photosystems are in different parts of the thylakoid(s)
    PS II is on the inside (within the grana stacks)
        no access to stroma needed, just water
        O2 evolved here
    ATP synthase and PS I is on stromal lamella
        plastocyanin is what's moving the longest distance here (stacks <-> lamella)

480nm light -> e- in rxn center special pair goes from +1.0V to -1.0V
    how much of the energy was transferred?

energy of 480nm photon:
    Ephoton = h*c/lambda

    h = 6.626e-34 J*s/photon
    c = 3e8 m/s
    lambda = 4.8e-7 m

    result: Ephoton = 4.141e-19 J/photon
    L = 6.02e23 photons/mol             ("Einstein" instead of "mol" for particles)
            283kJ/mol

energy required for e- from +1.0V -> -1.0V
    deltaG = z*F*(E'0_end - E'0_initial)
    z = -1
    F = 96.5 kJ/(V*mol)
    (E'0end - E'0initial) = -1V - +1V = -2V


    result: deltaG = 193kJ/mol


therefore, we have 90kJ missing (32%)
    => relaxation; dissipates some of the exciton's energy as heat
    the benefit is that we stabilize the exciton; without this, we would fluoresce
