membrane proteins

integral membrane proteins - can't be removed without disrupting the membrane
    lateral diffusion, just like phospholipids
    flipping is unfavorable

peripheral membrane proteins - weakly assoc. or tethered to some hydrophobic group

consider one step of ETC in green plants:
    electrons coming thru cytochrome b6f (pumping protons) => plastocyanin => PS1 (where they
                                                                recharge special pair)

        constraining diffusion to 2 dimensions makes the "searching" more efficient

if there's an alpha helix going through the plasma membrane, the AAs will be hydrophobic

hydrophobic AAs
    leucine
    isoleucine
    valine
    phenylalanine
    methionine

weakly hydrophobic AAs (weak mostly because of less surface area)
    alanine
    cysteine

bioinformatically, you can identify the alpha helices going through membrane:
    13-16 hydrophobic AAs

amphipathic AAs (preferentially in interface btwn membrane and water):
    arginine
    tyrosine
    lysine

(for transporters only or for all trans-memb. proteins?)
    you have a cylinder made of ~6 alpha helices
        the inside has hydrophilic AAs
        the outside has hydrophobic AAs

---
there's another class of integral memb. protein
    found in outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and mitochondria
    integral membrane beta barrels
    beta sheet rolled into a cylinder

    no long stretches of hydrophobic AAs - instead, alternating(?)

---
peripheral membrane proteins

covalent modification
    palmitoylation (palmitic acid)
        internal cysteine forming a thioester bond to palmitate
        reversible process!

    myristoylation
        common in bacteria
        protein's N-terminal
        irreversible

    farnesyl/geranylgeranyl
        C-terminal cysteine

can have a hydrophobic alpha helix tethering protein to membrane
also ionic interactions with head groups

the above are intracellular because not really stable

can also have extracellular:
    GPI-linkage - tether a protein to the outside of the cell
    C-terminal of protein hooked up in an amide bond to ethanolamine

----
membrane asymmetry

lipid rafts - common in animal cells (not present in bacteria)
    a little piece of the membrane that is a bit thicker
    larger hydrophobic domains
    rich in sphingolipids with long acyl chains attached to them
    also higher cholesterol content

    purpose:
        transmembrane proteins with longer hydrophobic domains are stuck in the lipid rafts
            GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors)
                advantage: more rapid responses
        likewise, transmemb. proteins w/ shorter ones can't get in

another kind of asymmetry is inside vs. outside
    only well characterized in animals
    
    sphingolipids, phosphatidylcholine

    glycosylated lipids preferentially on outer face

    inner membrane tends to have phospholipids
        preferential head groups: serine, ethanolamine, inositol

    also, integral membrane proteins have a preferred orientation, and can't flip around

E'0inside - E'0outside = -0.07 V

145mM Na+ outside
12mM Na+ inside

consider the deltaG of transporting Na+ from outside to inside
    deltaG = RT ln [Cout]/[Cin]  +  z F (E'0out - E'0in)
                ln 12mM / 145mM
                    -2.5
                -6.44 kJ/mol
                                    +1 * 96.5 kJ/(V mol) * -0.07V
                                            -6.76 kJ/mol
