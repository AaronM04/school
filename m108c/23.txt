Lecture 23 - eukaryotic transcription termination

mRNA has AAUAAA - poly-Adenylation complex

hundreds of adenylates added by adenyl(?) transferase enzyme
    no template, but otherwise a normal polymerization reaction

CBP bound to 5' cap and PABP2 bound to poly(A) tail
    protect mRNA from degradation

when does poly(A) stop?
    no one knows, but some evidence for:
        ribosomal RNA operon involved - "La"

needs to be exported from nucleus to cytoplasm

nuclear pore complex (NPC)
    active transport driven by Ran-GTP gradient (high in nucleus, low in cytoplasm)
    in cytoplasm, hydrolized to Ran-GDP => export protein released
    (Ran-GTP is part of a cycle)

CBP recruits ALY factor; ALY in turn recruits other proteins

mRNA bound "up and down" by proteins (junction binding complexes (JBCs)?)
    the JBCs can also recruit ALY

nuclear export factors (Nxt1/NFT1 heterodimer) displace ALY
    this heterodimer docks to the NPC (nuclear pore complex)

on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, there are ATP-consuming "helicase-like things" which
rip off Nxt1/Nft1 heterodimer
    the unbound Nxt1 and Nft1 get imported back into nucleus
    "also PABP2 comes along for the ride"

in the cytoplasm, mRNA has PABP2 (still) and CBP20/80
then, eIF displaces CBP20/80, which results in mRNA "curled up into a circle; really stable"
    can persist in this packaged form for hours/days
    then, ribosomes get recruited

in contrast, prokaryotes don't do any of this shit
    mRNA half-life is about 3 minutes; only translated 5-10 times per mRNA molecule

energy for export from nucleus is ATP; needed to rip off these transport factors, driving
the rxn forward
