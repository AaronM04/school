fluidity
selective permeability

asymmetric

dielectric constant
    permittivity of a medium to charge
    minimizing an electric field is favorable

H2O has a high dielectric constant, meaning it can permit a charge - minimize electric field

when counter-charges come near, the electric field is reduced

lipids have a very low dielectric constant

deltaG = 167 kJ/mol to move Na+ from water into lipid ~ 5 ATPs worth of energy
    this is why ions don't go through membranes

consider water moving across a membrane:
    the main thing is breaking of H-bonds
    1 H-bond -> 0 H-bonds  deltaG ~ 6 kJ/mol - unfavorable, but not terribly so
    for a whole water molecule, it's about 6-20 kJ/mol

hydrophobicity
    the more hydrophobic you are, the more permeable you are

size
    if you have something big, and you put it in the membrane, it will affect its properties

    must find "free volume"
    the membrane has to distort to make room
    this distortion leads to an inc. in surface area btwn. water and lipid components

movement of a proton across a membrane down its gradient
    deltaG = RT ln [Cend]/[Cinitial] + z F (E'0end - E'0initial)
    R = 8.315 J/(mol K)
    T = absolute temp.
    Cend and Cinitial are ending and initial concentrations, respectively
    z = charge of solute
    F = 96.5 kJ/(mol V)

    common membrane potential: E'0inside - E'0outside = -0.07 V

transporters
    ion channels
    "facilitated diffusion" channels

    ion channels - discriminates among solutes

    glucose transporter in RBCs
        blood has higher conc. than cytosol
        glucose passively diffuses into cell

    primary active transporters
        ATP -> ADP + Pi
        moves solute against its electrochem. gradient
        Na+/K+ ATPase - most important of these
            burns 1 ATP, moving 3 Na+ from inside to outside, and 2 K+ from outside to inside
            Na+ is uphill both chemically and electrically; K+ is about even

    secondary active transporters
        move two solutes, either in same or in opposite directions
        one moves against electrochem gradient, and other is moving with electrochem grad.
            coupled!

        AA import coupled to Na+ import - the Na+ gradient was created by Na+/K+ ATPase

    gram negative bacteria
        two membranes
        fiercely compete for vitamin B12; not easy to synthesize
            how to transport?
                no primary transport since no ATP between the membranes
                no secondary transport because ???
                answer: colicins

            colicins are toxins; they kill other bacteria (their competitors)
                bind receptor on outer membrane, get through, use proton motive force to
                get through inner membrane

            the TonB mutant can't take up vitamin B12

        new type of transport discovered!
            ExbB and ExbD in inner membrane - harvest proton-motive force
            TonB is a long rod that moves back and forth - mechanical transport
