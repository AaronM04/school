Lecture 24 - prokaryotic translation

Overview
    ribosomes
    tRNAs
    translation factors

    initiation
    decode mRNA
    tRNAs base pair with the mRNA
    catalysis
    translocation
    termination

tRNA has cloverleaf secondary structure
    anticodon loop - base-pairs with mRNA
    3' end is conserved - always a CCA sequence, but not necessarily in gene
    (added on by enzyme)
        AAs added on to the 3' OH

correct AA must be added; done by amino-acyl tRNA synthetase
    must recognize unique elements in each tRNA:
        anti-codon loop (some synthetases use it; problem: far away from CCA end)
        dsRNA region near CCA sequence, and nearer stem-loop (most common)
    "easy to recognize the AA - has R group"

COO- of AA attacks a phosphate in ATP => activated AA

the A's OH (really O- after proton abstracted) at the 3' end of the tRNA attacks the carbonyl
in the activated AA => AMP leaves

Proofreading activity
    happens in separate active site of amino-acyl tRNA synthetase
    makes sure we have the right AA
    if incorrect, the AA is hydrolyzed off
    but if correct, the enzyme disassociates
    with this proofreading, the error rate is 1 in 10000 (mostly isoleucine/leucine)

once the AA is on the tRNA, called aminoacyl tRNA or "charged" tRNA
    immediately bound by EF-tu (most abundant protein in bacteria)
    EF-tu has same affinity for every aminoacyl tRNA

---
how do we know where to start translation? start codon (AUG) can happen randomly
    upstream is a shine-dalgarno sequence: AGGAGG consensus sequence - 5-10bp upstream

ribosomes:

50S - large subunit
30S - small subunit
the two subunits can be disassociated and reassociated

before translation starts, initiation starts w/ just the 30S
30S is bound by IF1 - binds A site, preventing tRNAs from associating w/ it
IF3 helps prevent 50S from associating w/ 30S
associates non-specifically w/ ssRNA - slides along 5' to 3'
    (recall prokaryotic transcription - also scanning)

rRNA has UCCUCC complementary to Shine-dalgarno sequence

in prokaryotes, first AA is N-formyl Met

IF2 makes sure that everything is assembled correctly, then recruits 50S subunit
and hydrolizes the GTP attached to itself (IF2)
    => all IF's fall off
    "happens _so fast_; nobody has identified any sub-steps"

---
now the A site is free - tRNAs come into it (still bound to EF-tu-GTP)
they must base-pair with the mRNA sequence next to the A site
proofreading:
    if incorrect, boot off tRNA (and EF-tu)
    if correct, GTP hydrolized and EF-tu disassociates
    this allows peptidyl transfer to happen

N lone pair on AA of A site tRNA attacks the C=O of the P site tRNA
    the tRNA is the leaving group

as the AA chain grows, it protrudes out of a tunnel in the 50S subunit

--
translocation:

the uncharged tRNA gets booted out the back
ribosome must go exactly 3 bases forward - the 3 paired bases at the P site tRNA is 
very important for this

can have a wobble base pair (G=U) at the 3 position (but not 1 or 2 positions)

wobble bases are prevented at 1 and 2 positions because the tRNA will pop out if "hugged"
    one tRNA can decode multiple mRNA codons
