Rubisco, oxygenase activity, C4 + CAM

photorespiration! :(

ribulose 1,5-bis(P) + O2  -> ### -> 2-(P)-glycolate (BAD) + CO(P)-COH-COO-

all plants have a pathway to deal with 2-(P)-glycolate

stroma:
    2-(P)-glycolate made here
    Pi comes off -> 2*glycolate
    2*glycolate goes to the peroxisome

peroxisome:
    2*glycolate + 2*O2 --> 2*glyoxylate + 2*H2O2

    transamination:
    2*glyoxylate + 2*serine -> 2*glycine + 2*hydroxypyruvate
    
        (hydroxypyruvate gets recycled to serine)

    2*glycine goes to mitochondria

mitochondria:
    2*glycine + NAD+ -> serine + NADH + NH3 + CO2    <--- the CO2 is kinda important

    serine goes back to peroxisome

peroxisome (again):
    serine -> hydroxypyruvate (see above)
    hydroxypyruvate + NADH -> glycerate + NAD+
    glycerate goes back to chloroplast stroma

stroma (again):
    glycerate + ATP -> 3-PG + ADP
    3PG goes back into Calvin cycle

----
total costs of photorespiration (per 2 O2):
    CO2
    1 ATP
    1 NADPH
    1 ATP
    1/2 ATP

carboxylase:
    +3 CO2
    -9 ATP
    -6 NADPH

costly!

"we've mitigated some of our carbon loss"

at 100F, 40% of Rubisco activity is oxygenase
    +2 CO2
    -7 NADPH
    -11.5 ATPs

Ways plants reduce this problem:
    C4 system:
        two different kinds of cells
        mesophyll cells:
            exposed on the surface; have gas exchange
            CO2 + PEP -> oxaloacetate (4 carbons) + Pi
            oxaloacetate + NADPH -> malate + NADP+    (the CO2 is "trapped" on here)
            malate goes to bundle-sheath cells

        bundle-sheath cells (stroma):
            malate + NADP+ ----malic-enzyme---> CO2 "right in Rubisco's face"
                                                        (+ NADPH + pyruvate)
            pyruvate goes back to mesophyll cells

            !!!no PS II in this cell (would make O2); no source of e-!!!
                - good thing we made NADPH above!

            PS I:
                PS I -> ferrodoxin -> Cyt b6f (pumps H+) -> plastocyanin
                plastocyanin shuttles electrons back into PS I
                "run electrons around in circles to generate proton gradient"

        mesophyll cells (again):
            pyruvate + ATP + Pi -> PEP + AMP + PPi   (this drives the rxn fast forward)
            production of PEP completes the cycle

        C4 costs:
            2 more ATP's... still more efficient

        convergent evolution of plants on different continents

        C4 problem: lose H2O

    CAM system:
        modified version of the C4 system; better for retaining H2O
        temporal, rather than spatial, separation
        gas exchange regulated by stomata
        at night:
            allow gas exchange
            cooler, so don't lose as much H2O
            make malate, store it in a vacuole

        during day:
            malate taken from vacuoles
            CO2 released

        CAM problem: you can't grow very fast
