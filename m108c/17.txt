Lecture 17 - purine & pyrimidine biosynth.

ribose-5-(P) + ATP ---> PRPP + glutamine + H2O -> phosphoribosylamine + glutamate + PPi

phosphoribosylamine -> -> -> -> -> IMP -> -> -> AMP or GMP
            (there are 3 steps that burn ATP without being required - makes go faster!)

they never saw the phosphoribosylamine product accumulate
    the problem is that it hydrolyzes very rapidly

purinosome
    all the above enzymes in a complex
    the enzymes appear to have substrate channels "that go to nowhere" (unless in complex!)

--

IMP (inosine monophosphate) is common precursor for AMP and GMP

IMP + GTP -> ### -> ---lyase--> ###     [AMP path; look up in book]

can also make GMP [look up in book]
    we gain reducing power (NAD+ -> NADH)

if we want to make more AMP, we use GTP power

--
regulation:

AMP and GMP get phosphorylated to ATP and GTP

"at any time, we need a reasonable pool of purine triphosphates around"

when we're low on energy:
    ADP --| (ribose-5-P -> PRPP)

but just for regulation of purines:
    PRPP -> phosphoribosylamine
        inhibited by AMP, GMP, and IMP

IMP -> -> -> AMP   <== first step inhibited by AMP
    (and likewise for GMP)


----
pyrimidines
"way easier than purines" :)

carbamoyl-(P) + aspartate -> ??? + Pi
??? -> dihydroorotate + H2O
dihydroorotate + NAD+ -> orotate + NADPH     ("get a little reducing power")
orotate + PRPP -> orotitilate(sic?) -> UMP + CO2
    ("CO2's a fantastic leaving group")
    UMP - first usable monophosphate

for the pyrimidine biosynth, it's all linear

UMP ---phosphorylate-twice--> UTP

amidotransferase:
    UTP + glutamine + H2O + ATP -> CTP + glutamate + ADP + Pi

---
need to make dNTPs for DNA!

RNA can self-hydrolyze, because of its 2' -OH groups
    promoted by heat

therefore, for a stable storage medium, we must get rid of the 2' hydroxyls:
    works with NDPs, not NTPs or NMPs (NDP -> dNDP)
    (P)-(P)-ribose-base --ribonucleotide-reductase--> (P)-(P)-deoxyribose-base + H2O

    ribonucleotide reductase:
        primary allosteric reg. site  - on/off switch: ratio of ATP to dATP; turned on by ATP
        secondary allosteric reg. site
        active site

    ###

secondary regulatory site           active site specificity
-------------------------           -----------------------
    ATP/dATP bound                will only accept CDP&UDP -> dCDP&dUDP
                                                    other enzymes do dUDP -> -> -> dTTP
                                                        (targeted by some antibiotics)
    dTTP                          will only accept GDP -> dGDP
    dGTP                          will only accept ADP -> dADP

result - approx. equal concentrations of all deoxynucleotides

MT 2 - a week from monday
    second room!!! I will be in Buch 1910
