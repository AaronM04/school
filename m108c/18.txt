Lecture 18 - thymidilate synthase & nitrogen waste

*** MT 2 is through first part of today (thymidilate synthase NOT nitrogen waste)
*** through week 6-2 discussion sections

CDP --ribonucleotide-reductase--> dCDP (+ NTP) --> dCTP (+ NDP)
...and likewise for UDP, GDP, and ADP

dCTP --deaminase--> dUTP    (helps maintain balance)
dUTP --dUTPase--> dUMP      "important because we don't want uridine in our DNA"
dUMP --thymidilate-synthase--> dTMP (+ NTP) -> -> dTTP (+ NDP)
    (and this last product (dTTP) is what we want in our DNA)

thymidilate synthase:
    need source of fully reduced carbon to do methyl transfer to make dTMP from dUMP
    cofactor (supplies the C): N5,N10-methylene THF
    "pretty gnarly chemistry"

    problem: the cofactor methylene is partially oxidized: N-CH2-N, but
        we need fully reduced (-CH3)

        soln: oxidize a C within the cofactor in the process (making double bond)
            product is dihydrofolate; after this, reduced by NADPH to form THF;
            then, get the methylene back from serine to get original cofactor
            (+ glycine and water; catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyl transferase)

this cycle is a good target for chemotherapeutics (especially thymidilate synthase)
    also, THF involved in a lot of 1C transfers
    ex: 5-fluorouracil; gets taken up by scavenging pathways => attached to ribose
        we have 5-fluoro-dUMP; suicide substrate for thymidilate synthase!

    dihydrofolate reductase is specific to thymidine production, so we can also target this
        drugs: methotrexate - competitive inhibitor
               trimethoprim - only binds bacterial enzyme
                    an "end of the world" antibiotic

nitrogen waste

amino acid catabolism
metabolism of nucleotides

stomach: protein ---pepsin--> 4 AA pieces (pH 0.8)
duodenum: trypsin & chymotripsin: now at most 4 AA pieces (pH 7.0)
small intestine: absorbed
    in intestinal cells: broken down to individual AAs
dietary AAs
    recycle
    metabolize for energy

"drink a lot of water if you're on protein shakes - NO kidney stones!"

AAs from blood:
    first step is usually to get rid of the N somehow; ways we could do this:
        transamination reactions
        hydrolases/dehydrogenases - release NH4, which must be done sparingly (toxic)

then, what do you do with the N?
    NH4 + glutamate --glutamine-synthetase--> glutamine
        (our version of Gln synthetase is always on, unlike in bacteria and plants)
    glutamate and glutamine go into blood -> liver -> urea

    but in muscle:
        any glutamate around gets its N transferred, to make alanine
        alanine -> blood -> liver

in liver:
    goal: lose as little C as possible (and preferably lose completely oxidized C)
    glutamate + alanine -> alpha-ketoglutarate + pyruvate
    also uptake glutamine

    mitochondria takes Glu and Gln from cytoplasm:
        to run urea cycle: need 1 aspartate and 1 NH4
        Gln + H2O -glutaminase-> glutamate + NH4
        glutamate + oxaloacetate -> aspartate + alpha-ketoglutarate

        secondary rxn to keep balance btwn Asp&NH4: Glu -dehydrogenase-> NH4
        
    any steps w/ free NH4 must happen in mitochondria, but must steps of urea cycle
    happen in cytoplasm

    urea cycle:
        [read book!]
        mitochondria:
        ### -(consume-ATP)-> carbamoyl phosphate
        carbamoyl phosphate + ornithine -> citrulline + Pi  (ornithine comes from cytoplasm)
        citrulline goes to cytoplasm
        citrulline + ATP -> citrulline-AMP + PPi
        citrulline-AMP + aspartate -> arginosuccinate + AMP
        arginosuccinate(sic?) --lyase--> arginine + fumarate
            ("this is how all organisms synth arginine; we only stop here
              if we need arginine")

        arginine + H2O -> urea + ornithine     (the ornithine completes the cycle)

        urea is much less toxic than NH4

        urea's carbon is completely oxidized :)

how do plants get rid of their nitrogen waste?
    trick question: they don't ever have nitrogen waste! they _want_ nitrogen!

how do fish get rid of their nitrogen waste?
    NH4 diffuses from their gills

    aspartate + IMP -> adenylsuccinate -> fumarate + AMP
    AMP --deaminase-> IMP + NH4    (the IMP completes the cycle)

how do birds & reptiles get rid of their nitrogen waste?
    problem: waste must not be water soluble

    uric acid! no urea cycle

    aspartate + glutamine  -> -> -> (purine biosynth) -> IMP
    IMP -> ribose-5-(P) -> hypoxanthine
    hypoxanthine --hypoxanthine-oxidase-> uric acid
