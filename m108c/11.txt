Liver
    VLDL - very low density lipoprotein
    exocytoses chylomicrons into the blood

chylomicron:
    inside: TAGs
    apolipoproteins and glycophospholipids in the outermost layer

apolipoproteins we will cover:
    ApoB100
    ApoE
    ApoCII

chylomicrons travel through blood
when they get to cell membrane:
    lipase binds to ApoCII

VLDL gets converted to LDL, because it lost some fat - hydrophobic core shrinks
    this shrinking causes ApoB100 to become accessible on the surface
    this is a cell that is hungry

ApoB100 interacts w/ LDL receptor, causing endocytosis of the whole thing
    this is a cell that needs cholesterol

but suppose that cells are well fed - ApoE mediates endocytosis into the liver

what happens if there's too much cholesterol in a cell?
    liver makes HDLp - HDL precursor - just protein
    a cell endocytoses HDLp, packs w/ cholesterol, and exocytoses - actual HDL

specialized transport system for adrenal glands and gonads:
    take cholesterol from HDL without endocytosis
    cholesterol used to make steroid hormones

VLDL -> free FA
    or
FA bound to albumin -> free FA

the free FA gets transported by the FATPs (fatty acid transport proteins)
    we don't know much about this
    albumin has very high affinity for FAs - how do we get the FA off?

on the cytoplasmic side, CoA + ATP + FA -> CoA-FA thioester

CoA-FA + carnitine -> acylcarnitine + CoA

carnitine is the transporter through the mitochondrial membrane
    antiporters on both outer and inner membrane have free carnitine going the other way
    once inside, beta-oxidation

steroid hormones

cholesterol - very hydrophobic - only has an -OH
    increase membrane stability at interface
    increases membrane fluidity

cholesterol + NADPH + 2 O2 ---mixed-fcn-oxidase--> (two -OH added) + NADP+ + 2 H2O

(two -OH added) + O2 ---desmolase--> pregnenalone + 2 H2O + NADP+ (book has
                                                                typo - only one H2O in book)

pregnenalone is precursor to all steroid hormones - has carbonyl
    many pathways off of it

testosterone vs. estradiol

7-dehydroxycholesterol --UV light--> ??? -> vitamin D3 (not done yet)
    vitamin D3 need for:
        calcium transport
        immune system function

hormones need to be more hydrophilic than cholesterol

---
phospholipids can flip from one leaf to the other - not favorable
rapid lateral diffusion, on the other hand

membranes
    - fluids
    - lateral diffusion
    - ~50% of mass is protein
        perhaps most of biology happens here, but membrane biochemistry not well studied
    - selectively permeable

leaflets are asymmetric - head groups, protein content, glycosylation
    glycosyl groups only presented to outside of cell
