Lecture 16 - amidotransferases + transamination reactions

amidotransfer reactions
    N comes from side-chain of glutamine

    NH3 lone pair attacks a ketone -> -> an imine (H2O comes off)  [look in book]

    what if an N is neighboring the ketone instead of C? resonance:
        R'-N-C=O-R <-> R'-N=C(-O-)-R + ATP -> R'-N=C(-R)-O-(P) + NH3 -> R'-N=C(-R)-NH2

transaminations
    usually use glutamate (becomes alpha-ketoglutarate)
    cofactor: pyridoxal phosphate
    -OOC-C=O-R' -> -OOC-C(-NH3)-R'

    pyridoxal phosphate:
        Enzyme's Lys-N=C-(complicated substituted benzene) + glutamate
        glutamate's -NH3 lone pair attacks a C

    a C in pyridoxal phosphate gets reduced, and the C in glutamate gets oxidized

    now, let's bring in pyruvate; "now, all the reactions go backwards"

alpha-amino acids
    pyruvate + glutamate -> alanine + alpha-ketoglutarate
    hydroxypyruvate + glutamate -> serine + alpha-ketoglutarate
    oxaloacetate + ... -> aspartate + ...

---
tryptophan: -OOC-C(-R)-NH3
    the R is pretty much built one carbon at a time
    12 dedicated reactions

histidine
    also hard to make
    9 dedicated reactions

Essential AAs
    "pretty much any AA that's hard to make, we don't do it"
    W tryptophan
    T threonine
    F phenylalanine
    H histidine
    V valine
    Y tyrosine
    M methionine
    I isoleucine
    L leucine
    K lysine
    also arginine, kind of - we can make most but not all of what we need

purines: adenosine + guanosine (inosine)
pyrimidines: cytosine, thymidine, uridine

"part of pentose phosphate shunt"

ribose-1-(P) + ATP -> PRPP: ribose-1-(P)-(P) + AMP
        PRPP not just for nucleotide synth, but also for other things (at least in bacteria)

PRPP ---amidotransfer--> phosphoribosylamine + PPi
            or
PRPP + base -> ribose-base + PPi

-> -> -> -> -> -> inosine monophosphate (2 N came from amidotransferases)
                    also contains an entire glycine

inosine monophosphate + ATP -> ??? + aspartate -> adenylsuccinate + Pi
adenylsuccinate ---lyase--> fumarate + ???
