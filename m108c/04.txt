Lecture 4

1. aldolase, then dephosphorylation
2. ketolase
3. aldolase #2, then dephosphorylation
4. ketolase #2

    we end up w/ 2 molecules of xylulose-5-(P) and one ribose-5-(P)

    the above two dephosphorylations have large negative deltaG's, making the rxn go forward

---
xylulose-5-(P) ---epimerase--> HO-C-C=O-COH-COH-CO(P) (ribulose-5-(P))

ribose-5-(P) ---isomerase-->  also ribulose-5-(P)

now, we have 3 ribulose-5-(P) + 3ATP ---ribulose-5-(P) kinase--> CO(P)-C=O-COH-COH-CO(P)
                                                                ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate

why large negative deltaG on dephosphorylation?
    partly entropy, but mainly solubility
    relative concentrations are also important
    ("these three factors determine deltaG's for _all_ the rxns in the Calvin cycle")

---
we want to move this out of the chloroplast into the cytoplasm:
    carbon
    ATP
    NADPH

In stroma:
    R-1,5BP + CO2 ---rubisco--> 3PG + ATP -> bisphosphoglycerate + NADPH --> G3P

    G3P <---> DHAP

    transporter ("Pi-triose-(P) antiporter") takes DHAP to cytoplasm in exchange for Pi

In cytoplasm:
    DHAP -> biosynth, but also:
    DHAP <--> G3P
    G3P + Pi + NAD+ ---G3P dehydrogenase--> bisphosphoglycerate
    bisphosphoglycerate + ATP ---3PG kinase----> 3PG

    3PG goes back into stroma in exchange for Pi


------------
In the dark, we want to shut down the Calvin cycle at night; biosynth continues

we want to stop the enzyme(s) with the largest deltaG

how do we know whether the light is shining?
    PS II's ETC is a proton-motive force, pumping protons into the lumen of the thylakoid

    the stroma becomes more alkaline (increased pH)

    there is also a channel in the thylakoid membrane that allows Mg2+ to pass through
        (balances charges)

    as a result, the stroma has high Mg2+

    disulfide exchange: in PS I's ETC:
        ferridoxin has two -SH (free thiols)
        thioredoxin (in stroma) has disulfide bond
        the above two can be exchanged!

        thioredoxin now hase two free thiols, and can "run off" => reducing environment
                                                                    in the stroma
                                                            ("electrons are up for grabs")

        some enzyme is inactive when it has a disulfide bond
            thioredoxin can come in and reduce it, resulting in free thiols on the enzyme

            the enzyme is now active

    we have three things: increased pH and [Mg2+], and disulfide exchange (thioredoxin)

    increased pH                incr. [Mg2+]                disulfide exchg

    fructose-1,6-bis(P)ase      fructose-1,6-bis(P)ase      fructose-1,6-bis(P)ase
    ribulose-5-(P) kinase       RUBISCO                     sedoheptulose-1,7-bis(P)ase
    G3(P) dehydrogenase             (because cofactor)      ribulose-5-(P) kinase
        (prevents taking ATP                                G3(P) dehydrogenase
        back into stroma)
    RUBISCO
    RUBISCO activase

RUBISCO:
    carbamoylation of Lys201 is required for it to work
        happens spontaneously at higher pH

    dark inhibitor - 2-carboxyarabinotol, or something like it
        synthesized at night
        binds so tightly that ATP is needed; RUBISCO activase does this

        why isn't it a substrate for RUBISCO?!?
