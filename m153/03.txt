Lecture 3

Review: fertilization -> gastrulation

neurulation:
    ectoderm:
        neural plate -> neural groove
        neural tube becomes entire CNS

        the red cells (where the neural cells meet the ectoderm) become the
        neural crest - PNS ("and a bunch of other stuff")

    mesoderm:
        becomes notochord

<MTs and filaments>

cytoskeletal changes are responsible for these changes

cytochalasin
    CAMs - cell adhesion molecules

    cells have to be pretty close to one another in order for this to work

animal cap becomes determined (for neural tissue) after exposure to mesoderm
    experiment:
        before exposure, it can be isolated, and becomes epidermis
        after exposure, it can be isolated, and becomes neural tissue

Noggin identified as a neural inducer using DNA recomb. tech
    the approach was to look for the mRNA, not the protein

mRNA from Li+ treated embryos
    "expression cloning"
    mRNA --RT--> cDNA -> E. coli library ~10000 -> a lot of mRNA

    serial dilution to narrow down which E. coli has the right mRNA

activin
    member of a family of ligand called TGF[beta]
        (family of receptors)
    
    blocking signaling via a dom. neg. activin receptor leads to neuralization
    "maybe the default state is neural"

dissoc. of animal cap cells prior to gastrulation causes them to differentiate
into neurons in culture

    the key is the dissociation step - without this, becomes epidermal

    conclusion: neural, not epidermal, is the default of the ectoderm

some secreted factor (signaling molecule) can inhibit signaling through activin
receptors (or related receptors), and thereby promote neuralization by preventing
epidermalization

Xenopus is not amenable to genetic analysis
