Lecture 12

Review:
    ppl very comfortable w/ this model in the 1970's even though parts have not been
    verified

    assays got better...

    isolation of cDNA, then better antibody procedures

    result: it looks like NGF is being synth in right place at right time, and in
    right proportions

NGF promotes cell survival for sympathetic and sensory neurons
what about the CNS?

Hans Thoenen and Yves-Alain Barde:
    pig brain (1.5kg) -> fractionate and halo assay, repeatedly -> 1.5 ug BDNF

    BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor
    MW = 12.3 kDa
    pI = 10

    they chemically determined the AA seq of a small region of BDNF, and then used that
    to isolate a cDNA => provided the entire AA seq of BDNF

    65% homology to NGF! gene family: Neurotrophins

    brain cDNA library:
        brain => isolate mRNA => RTase => cDNA => ligate into plasmids => E. coli
        look for BDNF in E. coli

    BDNF expr patterns:
        very high levels in ###

are there more members of the Neurotrophin family?
    synth oligonucleotide primers corresponding to regions of homology
    use the primers to amplify a brain cDNA library
    sequence amplification productes
        should get NGF PCR products, BDNF PCR products, anything else???
        yes: NT3 and NT4

---------
how do NGF and the other neurotrophins work molecularly?

signal transduction is key to all of development

the hunt for the NGF receptors - Pamela Maher
    tyrosine phosphorylation and signal transduction
        a very big deal in oncogenesis
        maybe involved in NGF action?

    big and rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation correlates w/ NGF treatment; maybe
    involved in NGF action?

is tyrosine kinase activity part of NGF action?

Abl untreated, and treated w/ a Tyr kinase => put in rabbit => got Ab's
    the Ab's recognized everything on Abl, but some recognized the right region
    put through a column w/ beads covalently coupled to control Abl!!! clever as fuck
    the only thing that should come through is anti-phospho-Tyr

Bradshaw, Shooter, Greene
    the hunt for the NGF receptors: cross-linking strategies

    pc12 cells -> add radioactive NGF -> add covalent cross-linker ->
    fractionate proteins on SDS gel -> detect radioactivity

###

is this 85 + 60 model correct?
    column w/ anti-NGF Ab's
    ...
    if model is right, see 85 and 60 kDa bands

so, what is the 135 kDa band?
    convergence of neurobiology w/ cancer biology

    "orphan receptors" - receptors w/ no known ligand

    TrkA - transmemb. protein

expts supporting the conclusion that TrkA is the 135kDa NGF receptor
    pc12 cells -> ###

    trkA rescues mutant PC12 cells unable to respond to NGF

dimeric ligands - bring two receptors together
    => change struct => activate kinase domains => phosphorylate each other

TrkA is also part of a family
    coevolution of ligands and receptors

###
The NGF signal can be acquired at the tips of growing neuronal processes to promote
neuronal cell survival
    the only place you need NGF is out at the extremities

How is survival signal relayed back to cell body?
    the signaling endosome hypothesis
        forms claithrin-coated vesicle from p.m. containing receptor-ligand complex
        => CREB activated => transcription


---
5. target-mediated apoptosis

two kinds of cell death
    apoptosis - purposeful act of suicide
    necrosis - withering away, from lack of nutrients
        initial swelling of the cell
        major inflammatory response

neuronal cell death can be delayed by blocking protein synth
    cells in a dish that have NGF => remove NGF => cells die
    but if treat w/ protein synth. inhibitors first, they don't die
