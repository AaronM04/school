Lecture 13

Review:
    <go back to the protein purification assay w/ some modifications to adapt
    to the new question...>
        (same type of halo assay, but w/ a non-NGF-responsive ganglion)

    <are there more members of the Neurotrophin family?>
        yes, NT-3,4

    also CTNF and GDNF

    how does NGF work?
        <sig. transd. is key to all of devel. - recurring slide!>

    paracrine signaling
        receptor tyrosine kinases

    Pamela Maher's tyrosine phosphorylation expts

    <the hunt for the NGF receptors: cross linking strategies>

    turns out there was no such thing as a 60kD protein (there is an 85kD protein though)
        (Dr. Feinstein was working on this)

    so, what is the 135 kDa band?
        TrkA - known in a cancer context

        ***he'd really like us to understand <expts supporting the concl. that TrkA...>
            Ab against TrkA, attach bead to the Ab, precipitate, detach bead,
            immunoblot (Western blot)

    PC12 mutants that don't respond to NGF - don't have TrkA!
        can rescue w/ TrkA

    how does NGF prevent cell death?
        <how is the survival sig. relayed back to the cell body?>
            phosphorylation of TrkA -> form vesicle -> retrograde transport -> assoc. w/ CREB
            CREB phosphorylated -> go to nuc. -> alter gene expr.

2 kinds of cell death
    necrosis vs. apoptosis

neuronal cell death can be delayed by blocking protein synth.

<C. elegans cell lineage>
    adults have exactly 1090 cells in adult; 131 cells always die

genetic screens for mutations in C. elegans...
    look for animals w/ more or fewer cells

    ced-3,4 - mutant animals w/ no cell death
        normal function of this gene must be to promote cell death

    ced-9 - mutant animals w/ extra cell death
        normal function of this gene must be to prevent cell death

    are there mammalian homologs? clone genes (isolate cDNAs)

Ced-3 protein is a cysteine protease
    related to mammalian protein known as ICE (30% homology)
    
    ICE = interleukin converting enzyme
        converts IL-1beta precursor (a zymogen) to active IL-1beta

    "nobody would've guessed that this was involved - good thing about genetics compared
    to biochemistry"

Ced-3/ICE mediate cell death in worms and mammalian cells
    mammalian fibroblasts in culture (NOT neurons)
    results:
        ced-3/ICE can mediate cell death via protease function in mammalian cells
            not via some non-protease property of ICE
        cell death machinery is in place and just need a trigger switch to be activated

how about ICE in neurons?

what next? how about ced-9?
    homologous to bcl-2 in mammals (23% homology)
    originally identified as cancer-causing oncogene
    normally, increased bcl-2 levels prevent lymphocytes from undergoing apoptosis
    
    Ced-9 worms => introduce mouse bcl-2 cDNA => normal levels of cell death
        therefore, mouse can substitute for worm!

will bcl-2 rescue mammalian cells?
    yes

how does it all work?
    in mice: Caspase-3 (homologous to worm Ced-3)
    Ced-9/bcl-2 is upstream of Ced-3/Caspase-3

it is all about the bcl-2:bax ratio - they dimerize!
    to repress cell death, cells need lots of bcl-2:bcl-2 dimers
    therefore, [bcl-2] must be greater than [bax]

paper title: intrinsically-determined cell death of developing cortical interneurons
    "seems to go against everything I've been saying - all extrinsic"

cortical interneurons
    normally, ~40% die in a bax-dependent manner
    if put into culture, ~40% die at same time as they would die in vivo
    40% die regardless of how many cells are transplanted (unlike PNS expts)

    concl.: cortical interneuron cell death is determined intrinsically, either
    cell autonomously or by some survival factor released by the interneurons
    themselves (autocrine)

    clinical trials to see if BDNF administration will help ppl w/ Parkinsons

next PDF: 7 - synaptogenesis

synapse: the specialized site at which comm. takes place btwn a neuron and its target cell
    very small: ~1 square micron

synaptogenesis: synapse formation

early 1900s:
    reticular theory vs neuron theory
    reticular theory: all neurons were fused into a syncytium
        explained speed of signal transmission, but not specificity
    we know neuron theory to be true
        synapses allow fast transmission, also unidirectional

an avg neuron receives 1000-10000 synapses on its dendrites and soma
neurotransmitters released by pre-synaptic cell

devel. of synaptic morphology
    more branching from 1 day to 9 weeks (during animal devel.)

    also, synaptic vesicles accumulate at pre-synaptic side of synapse

<rainbow-colored slide>
    from left to right is early synaptic devel to maturity
        first, a filopodium extends
        next, tight junction
        then, accumulate vesicles on both sides
        now, start to dump stuff into this space (basal lamina)

<the synapse>
    photoreceptor - bipolar cells

how a synapse is formed:
    inject Ca2+-sensitive dye
        gets redder when Ca2+ conc. increases - can observe in microscope

    if you touch the tip of growth cone w/ a muscle cell, you see bright red in the axon
    if you touch the tip w/ an inappropriate target, no change

    where does Ca2+ come from?
        must be from media (see bottom diagram)
        must be Ca2+ channels that open up

rapid adhesion btwn growth cone and post-synaptic muscle cell
    touch w/ target => very quick engagement of cell adhesion molecules
    hold together for a minute and a half (not much time) - see some stickiness
    for 15 min. => very tight assoc.

cell adhesion molecules and synapse formation
    "molecular view"
    Cadherins in both - transmemb. CAMs
    when they engage w/ each other, get binding via catenins to actin cytoskel.

    also, Nectins

<signals that promote growth cone diff...>

how are receptors all clustered near the basal lamina?
    <AChReceptor clustering on muscle fibers...>

    clustering is induced by contact w/ incoming neuron

the mature neuromuscular junction

"in the remaining time, I'm going to tell you a cool story"
can cut axons and kill muscle cells
must be something in the ECM that is sending instructions
"what did Jack McMahan's lab do?"
Agrin - protein present in the ECM of the basal lamina directing axons and motor cells to it
at Stanford, they isolated Agrin cDNA
    turns out there was alternative splicing of Agrin gene: Agrin0 and Agrin19
    Agrin0 causes incoming growth cone to stop moving and differentiate
    then, growth cone releases Agrin19 at same location - bind to MuSK receptor on muscle cell
    => AChR phosphorylation => ragrin(sic)
MuSK gene knockout has very screwed up nervous system
<Fig. 1 - Scaffold proteins organize cellular information flow>
    much faster than diffusion :)
