Lecture 15 - Alzheimer's Disease (start)

extra-cellular?:
    beta-secretase, not alpha-secretase, cleaves APP => abnormal fragment: beta-amyloid

intracellular:
    tau protein

a few key facts about Alzheimer's disease
    progressive memory loss, behavioral changes, cognitive skills

    most common form of dementia
        1.8% of US pop (5.4million patents)

    avg length btwn diagnosis & death: 8 years

    largest unmet medical need in the US

<the huge number of people requiring constant care...>
    ~50% prevalence in ppl over 85 years

    $200 billion in costs in 2012 for US alone

<Dennis Selkoe quote, again>

History
    1906 - Dr. Alois Alzheimer

clinical features of Alzheimer's disease
    onset typically 60-70 years of age

key cellular diff's btwn normal & Alzheimer's:
    i) extensive neuronal cell death
    ii) two abnormal ...

plaques surround the tangles! maybe related?

<neurofibrillary tangles & amyloid plaques>
    starts in entorhinal cortex (near the hippocampus)

spatio-temporal appearance of plaques & tangles in AD brains

---
what is the biochemistry of the plaques & tangles?
    plaques:
        A[beta] - small fragment of APP (amyloid precursor protein)
            (on radial glia)

    tangles:
        abnormal form of tau protein

    but these are just correlations... what about the causes?

what CAUSES neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's?
    integrate genetics & biochem

    use genetic strategies to determine causation
        Alzheimer's is usually not from being inherited (only ~1-2%)

    ###

two general classes of Alzheimer's disease
    sporadic
        >98% of cases
        usually >60 years of age
        3% of pop btwn 65 and 74

    familial
        ~2% of all cases
        early onset
        not a "single gene disorder"

genetic analysis of an Alzheimer's family
    autosomal dominant trait!

genetic analysis[...]
    mutations in the action of any of following cause Alzheimer's:
        APP
        Presenilin-1 ("PS-1")
        Presenilin-2 ("PS-2")

    mutations in the Tau gene _cause_ closely related dementias (FTDP-17, PSP, CBD)
        these dementias have neurofibrillary tangles but not amyloid plaques

        all 4 are autosomal dominant

    risk factors
        age
        ApoE allele (ApoE2, ApoE3, ApoE4)
            - involved in lipid metabolism

_how_ do errors in APP, PS-1, PS-2, and tau cause neuronal cell death & dementia?

APP is a transmemb protein - resides in the plasma membrane of neurons (especially
at synapses)
    single transmemb alpha helix
    big extracellular domain

enzymes clip in two places on the outside (beta-secretase) and inside the
membrane (gamma-secretase)
    release a big chunk and a small chunk (A[beta])

neuronal APP processing and amyloid fibril formation
    A[beta] peptide can form a beta-pleated sheet

    turns out that the plaques are neutral - it's the oligomers that are toxic!
        under normal circumstances, A[beta] is generated all the time and cleared/turned
        over at nearly equal rates; A[beta] clearance is mediated primarily by 2 proteases:
            neprolysin &
            insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)

        small perturbations of A[beta] clearance will result in accumulation of A[beta]
        in the brain

        A[beta] clearance from the CNS is reduced by approx. 30% in individuals w/ AD

mechanisms of A[beta] clearance

how do A[beta] oligomers cause neuronal cell death? don't know :(
    might A[beta] cause toxicity by forming ion (Ca2+) channels?

    artificial lipid bilayer => add A[beta] => oligomers of 4-6 that look like pores!
        in fact they are pores - act like Ca2+ ion channels

what else might contribute to Alzheimer's? AICD
    amyloid intracellular domain - the part left over from APP
    "not a whole lot of work going on w/ this"
    transgenic mouse that overexpr. AICD
        get tau aggregation & hyporphosphorylation => neurodegeneration => memory deficits

how might AICD work?
    AICD (maybe with fe65) => change transcription

presinilin 1 & 2:
    the other two genes that cause Alzheimer's
    part of gamma-secretase complex

<the neuronal cytoskel.>

major roles of MTs in neurons
    establishment & maintenance of cell morphology

    intracellular transport ("axonal transport") <- important for AD!

<but... tubulin purified from brain assembles...>
    super unstable
    
    in vitro, tau:
        co-purifies & binds directly to MTs
        promotes MT assembly
        suppresses MT dynamics

    in vivo, tau:
        necessary for initiating axon outgrowth
        promotes rate of axon outgrowth
        is necessary for axonal transport
        maintains axonal morphology

many neurodegenerative diseases exhibit abundant tau-positive filamentous legions

genetic linkage of Tau to FTDP-7, PSP, and CBD
    major difference: no amyloid plaques (also, starts fronto-temporally, not in hippocamp.)

two classes of tau mutations that map w/ the FTDP-17 phenotype
    first class - point mutations:
        most point mutations near carboxy terminus
        this is region that binds to MTs

    second class - alternative splicing mutations
        pre-mRNA has 4 repeats; you can get one repeat spliced out: called "3-repeat"

        fetal: all 3-repeat tau; adult: half and half 3- & 4-repeat tau

        FTDP-17: you have too much 4-repeat tau in adult

a single pathway to neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's and FTDP-17
                                            (hyperphosph?)
    APP dysfunction -> -> -> Tau dysfunction -> -> cell death
       (also->amyloid plaques?)           (-> NFTs -> ^)

    key observation: in cell culture, a[beta]-induced neuronal cell death is tau dependent
        therefore, tau is downstream of APP problems

    Alzheimer's is a problem further upstream of the FTDP-17 problem

    tau in neurofibrilary tangles is hyperphosphorylated, and this is widely believed (but
    Dr. Feinstein is skeptical) to be a key to Tau dysfunction in Alzheimer's and related
    dementias

how might tau dysfunction cause neurodegeneration?
    could either be loss of MT function or gain of NFT toxicity
    Dr. Feinstein leans toward the former

    or maybe it's both: Tau sequestered in the tangles => not enough tau for MT stabilization

prion - misfolded protein acts as template for protein misfolding
    maybe tau acts like this

    sometimes the NFTs are extracellular
        what if tau is released at one terminal and taken up into next cell?
