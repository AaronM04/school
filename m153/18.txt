Antibodies

spleen responds to a new antigen - B cells that happen to have their surface Ab's binding to
        the antigen will receive signals to a) proliferate, and b) pump out lots of Ab's

you get a polyclonal antiserum, because there are multiple such B cells

development of mAb's:
    fuse B cells with cells from a cancerous cell line
    will they become immortal and also still make these Ab's?

Are there more members of the Neurotrophin family?

two regions of high homology; we make primers that bind to these
###
we have to get BDNF and NGF or else something is wrong with the experiment
