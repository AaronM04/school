                lab5/ fluorescent micrographs (see insns3.jpg):
                    A&B/ - DAPI only; WAIT, I think it's not really 20x
                            (can't have 40Î¼m nuclei)
                            - oh damn! all 4 files are the same :(
                                solution: just say 'A and B had DAPI but not GFP (data not shown)'
                    C/10x_combined_4.psd - skewed
                    C/40x_combined_2.psd - apoptosis? two cells?
                    C/20x_combined_1.psd - skewed
