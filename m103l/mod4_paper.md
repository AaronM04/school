Title: ###

Abstract:

Introduction:
    PC-12 cells:
        used as a model for studying human neurons
            ###

        derived from rat pheochromocytomas

...methylisothiazolinone is hydrophilic and so does not penetrate well into the skin (###cite), 
Du, et al., 2002 - http://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/17/7408.full :
    Previous work has revealed the mechanism by which methylisothiazolinone
    causes the death of neurons: certain soluble zinc-binding proteins rely on
    thiol groups for their function, and so the cytosolic Zn2+ concentration
    increases when these thiol groups are oxidized by MIT.  The high
    concentration of Zn2+ leads to a signal transduction cascade ultimately
    resulting in apoptosis.
