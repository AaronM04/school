Title: ###

Abstract:

Introduction:
    PC-12 cells:
        used as a model for studying human neurons
            ###

        derived from rat pheochromocytomas
            ###

...methylisothiazolinone is hydrophilic and so does not penetrate well into the skin (###cite), 

Materials & Methods:
    (no Materials section; just include information inline)
    Neurite outgrowth under varying chemical conditions:
        ###
    SDS-PAGE:
        lysis buffer (###composition)

        volume and composition of solution loaded:
            loading buffer (###composition)
            amount of protein (mass): 240ug

        the type of gel used (stacking; resolving; composition)
            ###
        
        the voltage and duration
            200V for 40 min.

        which wells were which:
            ###
        
        other reagents (running buffer)
            ###
    Western blot:
        ###

Results:
    Data:
        Part I (Neurite outgrowth):

        Part II (Western blot):
            neurite count for these cells

            % confluence

            (protein count - already in .doc)

Discussion:
    are the results significant? no
    why didn't we get the results we expected?
        chambered slides:
            ###
        -/+ NGF:
            possibly we gave the cells normal media instead of diff. media

        Western blot:
            why two tubulin bands?
            why no actin? possibly the ### (the anti-actin Ab) didn't work or was degraded
