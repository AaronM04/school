Title: ###

Abstract:

Introduction:
    PC-12 cells:
        used as a model for studying human neurons
            ###

        derived from rat pheochromocytomas
            ###

...methylisothiazolinone is hydrophilic and so does not penetrate well into the skin (###cite),

Results:
    Data:
        Part I (Neurite outgrowth):
            ###
        Part II (Western blot):
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        

Discussion:
    are the results significant? no
    why didn't we get the results we expected?
        chambered slides:
            ###
        -/+ NGF:
            possibly we gave the cells normal media instead of diff. media

        Western blot:
            why two tubulin bands?
            why no actin?

    SDS-PAGE:
        ###Protein-II

        BEFORE SDS-PAGE: protein assay:
            nanodrop###

        volume and composition of solution loaded:
            loading buffer (###composition)
            amount of protein (mass): ###

        the type of gel used (stacking; resolving; composition)
            ###
        
        the voltage and duration
            200V for 40 min.

        which wells were which:
