Title: ###

Abstract:

Introduction:
    PC-12 cells:
        used as a model for studying human neurons
            ###

        derived from rat pheochromocytomas
            ###

...methylisothiazolinone is hydrophilic and so does not penetrate well into the skin (###cite), 
Du, et al., 2002 - http://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/17/7408.full :
    Previous work has revealed the mechanism by which methylisothiazolinone
    causes the death of neurons: certain soluble zinc-binding proteins rely on
    thiol groups for their function, and so the cytosolic Zn2+ concentration
    increases when these thiol groups are oxidized by MIT.  The high
    concentration of Zn2+ leads to a signal transduction cascade ultimately
    resulting in apoptosis.

    Data:
        Part I (Neurite outgrowth):
            ###
        Part II (Western blot):
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        

Discussion:
    are the results significant? no
    why didn't we get the results we expected?
        chambered slides:
            ###
        -/+ NGF:
            possibly we gave the cells normal media instead of diff. media

        Western blot:
            why two tubulin bands?
            why no actin?
