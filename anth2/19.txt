two worlds
    one part, the minority (mostly European descendents), is rich and prosperous
    the other part, the majority of countries, is poor and "underdeveloped"
    ###

colonialism
    colonialism: the active possession of territory by a foreign gov't

    most countries in the Americas gained independence btwn 1776 and 1825

    but in Africa and Asia, colonialism was really just getting started in 1800
    ###

early European expansion
--
in 1400, Europe was not the most advanced, wealthiest, most powerful
    Islamic countries were ascendent
    China was considerably wealthier

but European expansion transformed the world

technological and social innovations enabled European expansion
    navigation: caravel ship allowed sailing into the wind
    agriculture: monocultures created surpluses
        more efficient in terms of calories produced per unit of land
        requires a lot more work, though; required trade & interdependence
    joint-stock company
        precursors to contemporary public corporations
            run by directors, but owned by shareholders
            selling shares enabled the accumulation of capital to finance expeditions

            unlike individuals, JSC's are not restrained by moral obligations

            economically "rational" self-interested profit maximizers

        granted unchecked powers
            given monopoly control to conduct trade in certain geographical regions

            empowered to make treaties, occupy lands, levy taxes, raise armies, and
            wage wars!
                imagine if Microsoft could do all of this D8

            without moral restraints, they wielded their power w/ brutality

        results of the JSC's
            a huge success for Europe:
                fantastic riches for the shareholders and home nations
                this wealth became the basis for the Industrial Revolution

            a complete disaster for the occupied areas
                the JSC's:
                    looted their wealth
                    destroyed their subsistence systems & economies
                    pushed populations off of their land
                    destroyed entire cultures

            paved the way for colonialism
                now the governments were powerful enough to do what they were not
                able to do before

colonialism in the Americas
    the colonial period in the Americas was 1500~1825
        disease wiped out the native population and gave Europeans the advantage
            diseases originated from thousands of years of living in close proximity to
            domesticated animals

            few domesticated animals in the Americas

    Native American populations never truly achieved independence
        in most cases, the descendents of colonizers continue to control the land, the
        economies, and the political power
            in all of post-contact history, only two indigenous presidents in the Americas:
                Benito Juarez (past, Mexico) and Evo Morales (currently in Bolivia)

19th & 20th Century colonialism
    led by French & British, Europeans carved up much of the world
        ~20% of the world in the 1920's

    the Berlin conference
        1884: European leaders met and divided Africa amongst themselves

    colonizers argued that they were doing the colonized a favor!

    the colonial history is the root of civil wars and conflicts today

    [video: The Scramble for Africa]

Making colonialism profitable
    pillage & plunder
        gold, silver, art, artifacts, even humans were sent to Europe
        pillage & plunder are not good long-term strategies
    colonizers reorganized the modes of production
        indigenous modes of production were geared toward subsistence

        under colonialism, they were reorganized under European control to produce
        wealth for Europeans

    exterminate & replace strategy: remove natives and replace them w/ colonizers
    and/or slaves
        British, French, and Portuguese colonists in the Americas

        the growth of the United States during the 19th century

    control and exploit strategy: force natives to switch from subsistence agriculture to
    producing cash crops
        Spanish colonization of the Americas

        European colonization of Africa and Asia

colonialism
--
methods to force the change in mode of production from subsistence to cash crops:
        ("Europeans controlled capital, but needed to control land & labor")
    expropriation of land
        almost never content to work with small, independent farmers

    coerce labor:
        threat of guns and whips
            not preferred, because frequently led to rebellions

        taxes, which had to be paid in "the coin of the realm"

        active steps to suppress subsistence production
            give the natives no choice but to become laborers on plantations

"in many cases, the economic aspects of colonialism are still with us; much of the
valuable land is owned by foreign individuals or corporations; ex: Honduras: much
land owned by Dole & Chiquita - Hondurans often have no choice but to work for them"

the inability of ppl to feed themselves is a result of colonialism
    it is not an unfortunate side effect of colonization...
    it was the explicit policy of colonizers!
        they didn't want local people to have food sovereignty

to this day, much of the productive land throughout the "third world" is controlled by
foreign interests
    most of the profit goes to foreigners

Haiti
--
one of the most profitable French colonies (sugar)

the Louisiana purchase is related to the loss of Haiti:
    the French were only keeping it to grow food for Haitians

the native population was long since exterminated; repopulated by African slaves

the second country in the Americas to gain independence (1804)

former slaves were successful at establishing a self-reliant subsistence mode of
production
    small land-holders

    foreigners were not allowed to own land

    for over 100 years (until ~1905), Haiti was independent and prosperous
        better quality of life for African descendants than anywhere else in the Americas

        a lot of former US slaves migrated to Haiti

in the early 1900's, the US essentially recolonized Haiti
    ostensibly, the political instability put American business interests at risk

    in 1910, US State Dept organized a takeover of Haitian National Bank

1915-1933 - US marines occupy Haiti
    US marine commanders acted as provincial administrators

    "peacekeeping"

    Haiti must repay foreign debt - Haiti must sell some of its foreign land
    US required Haiti to overturn prohibition against foreigners owning land
        repaid foreign "debt" by selling land to foreign interests
        sugar plantation system began anew

Haiti is now the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere
    over 50% of Haitian food is now imported


World population
    10000 years ago, world population was ~5-10 million

    world population today is just over 7.1 billion

    almost all future growth will be in less developed countries

    two potential problems:
        malnutrition
        stress on the planet

    one person dies of malnutrition every 3 seconds in the world
        (one, two, three BANG one, two, three BANG, etc.)

        1600 ppl will die from malnutrition during our class today
            almost 1000 of these will be children

        near one billion ppl are chronically malnourished

Malnutrition
    is it a demand problem (overpopulation)?
        simply too many ppl for the available food? probably not yet

    is it a supply problem (agricultural underproduction)?
        improve crop varieties and gardening techniques

    ***it is a distribution problem (food security)!
