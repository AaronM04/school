Lecture 2

phonetics - study of all sounds and their minute differences
phonemics - study of meaningful groups of sounds within a language

the four fields
    physical or biological anthropology
    archaeology
    linguistics
    cultural anthropology

    it is important to remember that the discipline is holistic
    there are strong interconnections between the fields

physical/biological anthropology
    the study of human beings as biological organisms
    there are four main divisions:
        1. paleoanthropology [human paleontology]:
            the study of ancient humans and human evolution

            through fossil remains
            through paleontology

        2. primatology: the study of non-human primates
        3. human variation: the study of biological variation in contemporary populations
        and individuals

            forensics: variation in individuals
            race: variation in human populations

        4. biocultural/biosocial anthropology: the study of the relationship btwn human
        biology and culture
            focus on human evolution in the context of culture: how culture impacts evolution
            & how biology impacts culture

            a bridge or a divide?

            rigorous science or ethnocentric analysis?

archaeology
    archaeologists study cultures of the past through the excavation and analysis of the
    material culture they have left behind

    to reconstruct the cultures of the past, archaeologists rely on three kinds of material
    remains:
        1. artifacts: objects that have been made or modified by humans
        2. features: non-portable elements that have been made or modified by humans
        3. ecofacts: objects that were used but not modified by humans

linguistics
    anthropological linguists study spoken and written languages around the world and
    throughout time

    historical linguistics: the study of the emergence of language and how languages have
    changed through time

        glottochronology: the technique of determining the approximate date that two related
        languages began to diverge

    cultural linguistics (ethnolinguistics): the study of the relationship between culture
    and language
        
        how vocabularies respond to what is important in a culture

        how the categories of language can affect or reflect the way people categorize the
        world

        how grammatical structures can impact the way people perceive and think about the
        world

    sociolinguistics: the study of the relationship between language and social relations
        
        you speak in different ways to different people; what does this say about society?

        we use the way people speak to evaluate them (e.g., Southern accents)

    descriptive linguistics: the study of sounds, structures, and meanings within languages

phonemics & phonetics
    phonetics: the branch of linguistics that systematically studies all the sounds in
    a spoken language

    phonemics: the branch of linguistics that studies the meaningful groups of sounds in a
    language

    for ex: in American English, the phoneme /t/ includes many phonetic variations!
        the "t" sound in "Matt" (four possibilities)
            [?] Glottal stop
            [?t] unreleased, preglottalized
            [t] released, unaspirated
            [t^th] released, aspirated
        the "t" sound in "Bitter"
            is the same sound as the "r" sound in the Spanish word "pero"

    different languages group sounds differently
        the /t/ sound in "mate"     in Spanish is a /t/ sound
        the /t/ sound in "kitten"   in Spanish is not a sound
        the /t/ sound in "bitter"   in Spanish is an /r/ sound

    phonetically, they are three different sounds
    phonemically, they are all /t/ sounds in English

    the difference btwn phonetics and phonemics is perspective:
        the phonetic perspective tries to evaluate sound rigorously and scientifically, but
        ignores local categories and meanings

        the phonemic perspective ###

emics and etics
    the _etic_ approach: a rigorous and systematic attempt which uses cultural theories to
    analyze and describe culture

        phonetics: the branch of linguistics that rigorously and systematically studies
        all the sounds in a spoken language

    the _emic_ approach: an attempt to understand and describe the meanings that ideas and
    practices have to members of a culture.
        phonemics: the branch of linguistics that studies the meaningful groups of sounds in
        a language

        e           e
        theory      meanings
        i           i
        c           c

cultural anthropology
    ethnography: the anthropological description of a particular contemporary culture usually
    by means of direct fieldwork
        ethnography can be emic, etic, or both

    cultural anthropologists use both ethnography and ethnology to study culture

    ethnology: the comparative study of cultural differences and similarities

        ethnography                     ethnology
        ------------                    -----------
        descriptive                     comparative
        based on direct fieldwork       uses data collected by others
        focuses on a single culture     generalizes across cultures
