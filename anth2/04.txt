Lecture 4

[15 min late :(]

if a tree falls in the forest, and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound?
    NO!

the riddle is solved!
    when a tree falls it makes a wave (objectively)
    if somebody hears the wave, they will interpret it as a sound (Subjectively)

the critical distinction is btwn:
    the objective nature of the wave
    the subjective experience of the sound

the science of culture:
    aspects of culture exist objectively
    but much of culture is subjective

ontology: the study of what actually exists
    ontology = existence
    some things exist objectively (e.g., the tree, the wave, you)
    some things exist subjectively (e.g., sounds, colors, _meanings_)

science is the process of building knowledge about what exists
    "hard" science: the object of study exists objectively
    social science: the object of study often exists subjectively

epistemology: the study of nature and scope of knowledge
    epistemology = knowledge
    knowledge is always subjective to some degree

"hard" science: the objects of study exist objectively
    scientists try to build objective knowledge
    validity: the degree to which our understanding of something is objectively true
    reliability: the ability of others to independently construct the same knowledge

social science: the object of study is often subjective
    we are interested in _more_ than subjective existence
    we are interested in subjective meanings
        for example, a different kind of wave
            objectively, my hand moved
            subjectively, my hand moving has a meaning
    _credibility_: worthy of belief or confidence

    "the only way we can study the wave is to embrace (not eliminate) subjectivity"

intersubjectivity
    there is no objective perspective on culture!
        there is no One Truth

    cultural anthropology tries to build credible knowledge by combining different
    subjective perspectives = _Intersubjective_
        build an emic perspective
            grasp native points of view
        include etic perspectives

    ethnocentrism vs. cultural relativism
    etic and emic partially overlap with each other and with both of the above

early anthropology
    Edward Tylor: the first "Anthropologist"
        1871: "Primitive Culture"
        Psychic Unity: All human minds operate on the same "natural logic"
            a way to combat racism (prevalent at the time), although Tyler was somewhat
            racist...
        Comparative Method: "primitive" cultures represent earlier stages of "advanced"
        societies
        Armchair Anthropology: Used "data" from travelers, missionaries, and colonial
        administrators
            Book: "Notes and Queries on Anthropology for the use of Travelers and Residents
            in Uncivilized Lands"
    Lewis Henry Morgan
        Out of the Armchair and onto the Veranda
        1877 "Ancient Society"
        Unilineal social evolution: all societies pass through the same stages of evolution
        as they progress

            savagery -> barbarism -> civilization

        problems:
            ethnocentrism: everybody was evolving towards being Europeans
            unilinear (typologies and trajectories) - the whole continuum doesn't exist!

    Franz Boas
        historical particularism: each society is a collective representation of its
        unique historical past

        the first anthropologist to practice _Cultural Relativism_!

        fieldwork with the Kwakiutl around the turn of the 20th century
            Participant-Observation?

    Bronislaw Malinowski
        Fieldwork on the Trobriand Islands from 1915-18
        Participant-Observation: long-term, living with the "natives" as is done today
        Functionalism: the theory that all cultural practices and institutions serve a
        function

        unlike Boas, he looked at the emic perspective

    venn diagram again:
        ***this slide might come up on the midterm

video, pay attention to:
    his theory of functionalism
    his research method of Participant-Observation
    beliefs in and uses of magic
    the Kula exchange
