Social stratification
    the factors that determine social position may be ascribed or achieved
        ascribed status: a social position one is born into
            "race", sex, caste, inherited wealth

        achieved status: a social position that a person achieves on his or her own

    there are two types of social stratification
        social mobility: movement from one social strata to another

        class systems: a social stratification system wherein social strata form a
        continuum from low to high and social mobility is possible

        caste systems: a social stratification system wherein social strata are discrete
        types and social mobility is not possible

Class systems
    class level is determined by:
        personal achievement (achieved status)

        ascribed statuses (inherited wealth, "race," sex, etc.) play an important role

    meritocracy: a social stratification system in which the only attributes are
    ability and achievement
        one of the core values of America - we want to think of ourselves as a meritocracy

Social stratification
    stratification systems are reinforced w/ hegemony
        in the US, the idea that our society is a meritocracy is part of our hegemony
        
        in India, the idea that your caste position is reward or punishment for your
        previous lives is hegemony

    hegemony sometimes fails
        the civil rights movement, feminist movement, and the _occupy movement_
        the revolutions of 2011-2013: Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, Algeria,
        Jordan, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria

The American Dream
    If you work hard => you will succeed

    confirmation bias: we look for examples that confirm what we already believe

    but if we want to test the validity, we need to try to falsify it

    if you work hard => and have opportunities => you will succeed

    "America is the land of opportunity"

    "race", ethnicity, gender, and _wealth_ can be significant factors that limit or
    enhance individuals' opportunities

Race, Ethnicity, and Racism
    Ethnicity: a culturally constructed category based on perceived cultural differences

    Race: a culturally constructed category based on perceived physical differences

    Racism: may be directed towards racial or ethnic groups
        1) ideological racism: racial thinking
        2) active racism: discrimination and prejudice
        3) structural racism: embedded systems of privilege and oppression

    Episode 3: the house we live in]

A post-racial america?
    does the election of Barack Obama mean that we have become a post-racial society?

White privilege: the unearned assets
    "there's no profit in denying it, being white is a privilege"
    but what is the privilege?
        1. freedom from prejudice
        2. a world that caters to your color
        3. an economic inheritance from racial systems & subsidies

    "white privilege is an invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing
    in each day"

    we cannot move past racism by ignoring it

    before we can go "colorblind" we have to address the racial stratification in our system
