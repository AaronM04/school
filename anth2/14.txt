diff btwn contagious and imitative magic - having an object from a successful
person vs. acting like a successful person

the functions of religion
    cognitive functions: explain the unexplainable
        religion provides a cosmology that answers _questions of "what" and "how"_
            "science can address this"

    philosophical functions: explain meaning and purpose
        religion can answer _the question of "why",_ which addresses purposes and meanings
            "science cannot address this"
    
    is science replacing religion?
        we must draw a distinction between How and Why
            "how": the process
            "why": the purpose or meaning
                implies agency

            if you're scientific, you tend to conflate the two
                how did he die? cancer, because of smoking
                why did he die? cancer, because of smoking
            a religious person:
                how did he die? cancer, because of smoking
                why did he die? it was God's will

            ex: the Azande and the collapsing granary (Evans Pritchard(sic?))
                silos up on stilts
                the Azande sit underneath them because of the shade
                termites attack the support posts (you can see where this is going...)
                a granary collapses!
                    it's not that the Azande didn't understand termites
                    termites = _How_ the granary collapsed
                    witchcraft = _Why_ that granary collapsed at that time and injured
                    those people

                    partially a result of how the English language works - some other
                    languages draw a greater distinction btwn How and Why

        in terms of cognitive functions:
            many religions have ceded some "what" and "how" questions to science

        in terms of philosophical functions:
            science cannot answer "why": it cannot provide purpose or meaning

        in terms of emotional functions (give comfort)
            can science & technology provide comfort in the face of uncertainty

science & religion
    our society faces several major challenges
        climate change, energy crisis, depletion of natural resources, overpopulation,
        food scarcity

        a plurality of the class thinks we're screwed (neither science nor religion gives
        them comfort, lolz)

ritual ceremonies
    ritual ceremony: (rites): social ritual events or ceremonies
        ritual ceremonies function to increase social solidarity or help groups become
        adjusted to internal changes
            
    ritual stages
        1. separation: a participant is removed from their normal life
        2. liminality: a participant has an ambiguous social position where normal rules
            of behavior are suspended, modified, or reversed
        3. reincorporation: upon successful completion of the ritual, the participant is
        reincorporated into society, often with a new or modified status

    types of ritual ceremonies
        rites of passage: serve to transform an individual's social identity
            graduation, weddings, prom, fraternity/sorority initiations
            liminal stage is marked by the participants' ambiguous identity
            during the liminal stage, participants tolerate ordeals or perform liturgy

        rituals of intensification: serve to increase group solidarity
            liminal stage is marked by an intense emotional experience
            effervescence: the bubbling up of collective emotional intensity generated by
            worship
            communitas: a state of perceived solidarity, equality, and unity among people
            sharing ritual
            examples: religious services, sporting events, corporate retreats

        rituals of role reversal: serve to decrease social tension
            liminal stage is marked by a reversal of normal rules of behavior

            antistructure: the socially sanctioned use of behavior that radically violates
            social norms

            rituals of role reversal allow the expression of hostility btwn groups within
            a society without endangering the established social order

            do we have a ritual of role reversal in American culture?
                Halloween
                    we're told never to accept candy from strangers, but on Halloween,
                    we _demand_ it from strangers

                Halloween as a child and Halloween in IV
                    on the surface very different, but the structure and function are
                    largely the same

magic
    magic: a system of beliefs that involves the manipulation of "supernatural" forces for
    the purpose of intervening in human activities and natural events

        concerned w/ specific and immediate problems, whereas religion is more cosmology

            not every culture has strong divisions btwn these

    a universal feature of _religion_ is _animism_: the belief in individual souls
    a universal feature of _magic_ is _animatism_: the belief in a general and impersonal
    force

    magic depends on an animistic force
        mana: an impersonal supernatural force that pervades certain people or things and
        is believed to confer power, strength, and success [Melanesian cultures]
            ***in English, this is called "luck"!!!
                "I challenge you to come up w/ a definition of 'luck' that is substantially
                different from the above"
        
        my example: "the force" in Star Wars

    almost everybody does things that we could classify as magic

    from an etic perspective, luck and mana are the same
    from an emic perspective, luck and mana may be very different

    Magic on yourself
        both Malinowski and Gmelch argue that ppl use magic on themselves when two conditions
        are met:
            1. the outcome is important
            2. the outcome is not entirely under a person's control

        there are several ways to perform magic on yourself
            ritual behavior: stylized, arbitrary, repetitive, and exaggerated forms of
            behavior

            taboo: proscribed behaviors or utterances (the opposite of ritual)

            fetishes: material objects that embody "supernatural powers" on their owners

        examples: magic in baseball:
            pennies in cup for every time they hit a home run
            touch/kiss a lucky bat
            taboo: announcers don't actually mention if there's a no-hitter for their team
