Revolution in San Pablo
    "people were getting killed over control of a municipal gov't - only 800 ppl. wtf?"

    existing system
        super-structure - political ideology: Usos y Costumbres
            indigenous institution w/ some autonomy from Federal gov't

        structure - political structure: the cargo system
            when you turn 18, you have some task, then a year off, then a higher rank task
                ex: organizing a fiesta
            all unpaid; expected to participate

        infrastructure - material base: communal land system
            "really not a very egalitarian system"
                once you claim land (as long as you fulfill all political
                obligations), it functioned as if it were private property

            majority of ppl supported it - even saw it as part of their identity

    faction (a few families)!
        super-structure - political ideology: party-based democracy
            hegemony: traditional system is backward - we will bring modernization

            most important battle: win the hearts and minds of San Pablo ppl

        structure - revolution: to overthrow existing political structure
            run elections to elect a president - party-based system
            other ppl in favor of Usos y Costumbres elected a different president

            went up to the state supreme court, kicked to state legislature, they passed a
            resolution to recognize both presidents (didn't help!)

            the municipal building got occupied

            the party-based system told Whittle: "they're backwards; we want to bring
            modernization and progress"

        infrastructure - political goal: privatize the land

the biology of race
    how many biologically distinct races of humans are there? one!
    "I'm not just saying that to be PC - supported by genetics!"
    race: a culturally constructed category based on perceived physical differences
    the idea of different races is a story - it is hegemony

[ video: race ]

the ideology of race
    race: ###

    the ideology of race: ###
    
    the ideology of race is a fiction
        ethnicity or simple genetic traits: skin color
        complex traits that are genetic and cultural: intelligence, athletic ability
        cultural traits: work ethic, character

            no genetic concordance!

    but our perception is that there is a correlation
        today, many ppl think AAs are more athletically gifted than Caucasians

        the extinction hypothesis: 100 years ago, the accepted idea was that the African
        race was physically inferior
            the data was sound, but his analysis of it was flawed; he attributed shorter
            life-spans and worse health to innate characteristics, when actually it was
            the result of social conditions

    correlation btwn "races" & "success" (or the lack thereof) is a result of cultural
    & social factors
        there is inequality because of discrimination, oppression, privilege, and opportunity
        - not because of biology
