Ego's Matriline
    matrilineal descent: kinship affiliation ...

    cousins: ego's parent's siblings' children
    cross cousins: ego's parent's opposite-gender siblings' children
    parallel cousins: ego's parent's same-gender siblings' children

why is marrying cross-cousins important? because different lineages

"parallel" and "cross" are very etic - terms are not used in these societies
    brings relatives back into the lineage

Descent
    benefits of unilineal descent systems:
        kinship status is clear
            in bilateral (like our own), kinship status gets watered down with distance
            important for inheritance
        you are closely related to more people
        the lineage has a permanent existence
            "can be a corporate entity - social unit"

    corporate descent groups: unilineal (matrilineal or patrilineal) descent groups that:
        are permanent social units
        have an existence beyond the individuals who are members for a given period of time

        own property, manage resources, arrange marriages, etc.

Household
    household: a group of ppl who live together and share (some) resources
        nuclear family household: consists of a married couple and their children

        composite family household: consists of several nuclear families linked by a common
        spouse (polygamy)

        extended family household: consists of two or more lineally related kinfolk of the
        same sex, their spouses, and children

    residence patterns:
        neolocal: married couples set up new independent household
            family of orientation: the family into which one is born or adopted and raised

            family of procreation: the family that one forms by becoming a parent and
            raising one or more children
            
            families have a lifespan in this system

        patrilocal: wives move in with their husband's extended family
        matrilocal: husbands move in with their wife's extended family
        avunculocal: married couples move in with the husband's mother's brother

    patrilineal patrilocal household
        one of the most common
        wife of a man in a lineage has almost no status, until she has a son

    matrilineal households
        ex: Hopi culture
            your father is the fun guy who occasionally gives you things
            your mother's brother is the authoritarian

        matrilocal: married couples move in with the wife's extended family
            2/3 of matrilineal societies

        avunculocal:
            1/3 of matrilineal societies; men control the property
            ex: Kazakhstan, Kyrzygstan
