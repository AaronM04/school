Lecture 17
means and modes of production
    means of production: the factors or inputs that are required for any production process.
        land, labor, and capital

    land: includes land (space to do things) and natural resources

    labor: the human work that is invested in production

    capital: includes all human-made or owned resources (money, technology, knowledge,
        tractors, animals, factories, relationships, etc.)

    mode of production: the cultural system that organizes and allocates the means of
        production.

        a mode of production includes:
            land: the cultural rules concerning the ownership and control of land and
            resources

            _relations of production_: the social systems that organize labor (e.g.,
            wage, household, communal, cooperative)

            capital: the kinds of available capital and the rules about capital (e.g.,
            who controls the capital, how capital is allocated)

Capitalist mode of production
    private ownership of land, resources, and capital
        private ownership creates incentives
            to increase efficiency
            to externalize some of the costs of doing business
            _externality_: a cost that is not paid by the producer
                the more costs you can externalize, the more profit you can make
        
        wealth can be accumulated, stored, and inherited

        the means of production are controlled by relatively few individuals or firms

    relations of production are determined by the wage labor system
        the majority sell their labor to others

        the most valuable factor that individuals control is knowledge

Mode of production in San Pablo
    communal ownership of land
        every community member has access to land

    relations of production (labor)
        wage labor (100 pesos/day = $7.50/day) - very strong preference against this
        household labor (including children) - most common form
        cooperative labor: unpaid labor by non-household members
            a few days in advance, you personally invite ppl to do the work
            provide them with food and drink
            hard work!

            commonly used for burning a swidden or building a roof on a house
    
    _social capital_: the ability to secure benefits through membership in social groups
        In San Pablo, the most valuable factor that individuals control is social capital

        why do workers participate if they aren't getting paid?
            reciprocity, prestige, value, introjection, solidarity

Economic rationality
    in every system, people have economic decisions to make

    anthropologists analyze economic decisions differently than economists!
        1. self-interest
            economists assume that people are self-interested

            anthropologists argues that ppl are self-interested, but only within a range that
            is considered culturally and morally appropriate

        2. profit motive
            economists assume that the only rational economic decision is to maximize your
            income or profits

                there is only one rational strategy, and lots of irrational people!

            anthropologists assume that people make rational economic decisions
                people make decisions based on their knowledge of costs, benefits, and risks

    Alexander Cayanov explored important differences btwn Capitalist rationality and
    Peasant rationality

    the cost of labor
        in capitalism, the cost of labor is quantifiable in terms of wages

        peasants perform the labor themselves (they "self-exploit"); the cost of their
        labor is "drudgery"

    the goal of economic production
        the goal of Capitalist enterprise is maximizing profit

        the goal of Peasants is satisfying the consumption needs of their family

    Capitalist "rationality"
        calculates profitability as a function of quantifiable revenues less quantifiable
        expenses incl. wages

        rational to invest at the point that maximizes profitability

    Peasant "rationality"
        not determined by quantifiable costs, revenues, and profits

        "[Peasants'] degree of self-exploitation is determined by a peculiar equilibrium btwn
        family demand satisfaction and the drudgery of labor itself" (Chayanov)

    Different rationalities
        Capitalists balance marginal revenue w/ marginal cost

        Peasants balance drudgery of labor w/ family needs/wants

        _Peasant production decisions are rational even though they may be considerably
        different than capitalist decisions_

Corn in NAFTA
    under NAFTA, the price of corn in Mexico went down
        economists assumed that when prices dropped, the farmers would grow less corn on
        marginal lands

        but peasant farmers in San Pablo and throughout Mexico started growing more corn
        on marginal land!

    why are they growing more corn?
        _Peasant rationality_: balance the needs of the family against the drudgery of labor

        growing corn is still their best economic option

        since they are getting less money for their corn, they need to grow and sell more
        of it!

        given this context, their decision is perfectly rational

    misunderstanding their rationality has had significant social, economic, and
    environmental consequences

    rational economic actors may seek:
        to maximize profit, prestige, security, pleasure, or harmony

        to minimize work, drudgery, boredom, or risk

        to strike a balance btwn any of the above

        to ensure some minimum level of income

    these are all very rational goals given a particular cultural context

    but they result in dramatically different decisions

---
Cornelio and selling his beans
    price is normally 15 pesos/kg
    price went up to 18 pesos/kg - he just sold the normal amount
    price skyrocketed up to 30 pesos/kg - he didn't sell any!
    maximizing profit is not the only rational decision
    he wanted to maximize his family's security
    to us, wealth is money - to Cornelio, wealth is Beans
    to us, the value of beans is going up - to Cornelio, the value of pesos is going down
        (peso value _was_ going down: 10 pesos/$ -> 15 pesos/$)
