Malnutrition
--
is it a demand problem (overpopulation)?
is it a supply problem (agricultural underproduction)?
    Green Revolution in 1970's
_it is a distribution problem (food security)!_
    _food security_: the availability of food and the ability to access it
        right now, there is enough food production, but the food does not get to the ppl
        who need it

        80% of malnourished children live in countries that produce food surpluses
            malnourishment requires: poverty AND lack of access to land
                both remnants of colonialism
        applied anth'ists often work to increase food security
            economic development
        _food sovereignty_: restoring local control of the food supply

World population
--
Malnutrition is a problem, but it is not just a population problem!
Stress on the planet:
    how much human impact can the planet support?

    are we really living sustainably, or are we already living beyond
    planet's _carrying capacity_?

    intensive farming leads to soil exhaustion
        almost half of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded

        yields are maintained by using fertilizers made from fossil fuels

    intensive industrial agriculture is just one of many activities that are
    stressing the planet

    stress on the planet is a problem, but it's not just a population problem!
        I=PAT
            I = impact
            P = population
            A = affluence (level of consumption)
            T = technology (can reduce or increase impact)

    should we consume less?
        40% of people said "YES, we should, but I don't want to"

    doubtful that technology can solve it: historically, the populations w/ the most tech.
    had the largest impact on the environment

    population cannot grow forever
        world pop. growth = births - deaths

        2012 births: 134.5 million
        2012 deaths:  56.2 million

        either lower birth rates or increase death rates

    why are ppl having "too many" children?
        _common assumption_: ppl are uneducated or are following outmoded traditions
            solution is imagined to be that we need to educate them
            or prohibit them from having "too many" children

        _reality_: in poor families in the "Third World," children are economic assets

        they have lots of children as a survival strategy

        in wealthy families, children are economic liabilities

    if we want to reduce the number of children ppl have, the best course of action is to
    improve their economic situation

Urbanization
    The growth of city dwellers over the last 200 years
        1800 =  3% urban =   30 million
        1900 = 13% urban =  220 million
        2010 = 50% urban = 3300 million (3.3 billion

    the largest cities (urban agglomerations) in the world
        Tokyo, Tapan = 36.9 million
        Delhi, India = 21.9 million
        Mexico City
        NYC
        Sao Paulo, Brazil
        Shanghai
        Mumbai

        only Tokyo and NYC are in the developed world

    10 of the 12 largest urban agglomerations in the world are now in "developing" countries
    
    today, 3.6 billion people live in cities

    more than 1 billion people live in urban slums

    _urban slums_: heavy populated urban areas characterized by substandard housing and
    inadequate water, sewer, electricity, and trash service

    anticipated demographic trends over the next 50 years:
        pop. growth of at least 3 billion

        100% of the increase in global pop. is expected to be urban

        100% of the increase in global pop. is expected to be in poor countries

    future population growth = urban slum growth

poverty and inequality
    1,300,000,000 ppl survive on less than $1 per day
    over 3.5 billion (half of all ppl) survive on less than $2.50/day
    80% live on less than $10/day
    purchasing power parity is factored in in the above numbers!!!!

development theories
    _modernization approach_:
        poor nations are underdeveloped and "backward"
        they need to repeat the historical devel. of the wealthy nations
    loans and grants focused on three areas:
        improve infrastructure
        improve agricultural techniques and technology
        establish capitalist markets
    modernization projects resulted in:
        benefits for rich countries and the elites in target countries
        increasing urbanization and cheap factory labor
        largely failed to reduce poverty

    _human needs approach_: the elimination of absolute poverty is the principal
    goal of development aid

    in the 1970's, loans went to finance projects that focused on:
        increasing poor residents' access to land
        improved but simple farming techniques
        basic education
        access to clean water, basic health, and sanitation

    increasing role for anthropologists!

    many successes, but debt grew faster than the economy!

    _the neoliberal approach_
        _neoliberalism_: an economic theory that advocates free trade, free markets, and
        minimal government involvement or regulation
    in the 1980's, poor countries were offered loans only if they agreed to
    "structural adjustments"

    "structural adjustment" required poor nations to:
        privatize state-owned enterprises

        open their markets to free trade
            reduce subsidies and drop tariff boundaries

            often mandated exploitation of natural resources
        reduce spending on social programs (austerity measures)
    
    _the free trade model_
        based on the idea that economic development will occur if
        corporations, capital, and products are able to move freely
        btwn nations

        _multinational corporations (MNCs)_ are thought to be the most
        efficient agents of economic development
            MNC's bring jobs and develop economies
                        OR
            mnc's exploit powerless workers
