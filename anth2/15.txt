Review:
    Magic on yourself
        both Malinowski and Gmelch argue that ppl use magic on themselves when two conditions
        are met:
            1. the outcome is important
            2. the outcome is not entirely under a person's control

        there are several ways to perform magic on yourself
            ritual behavior: stylized, arbitrary, repetitive, and exaggerated forms of
            behavior

            taboo: proscribed behaviors or utterances
            fetishes: objects ###

Magic on other ppl
    witchcraft: a mental or psychic capacity to cause harm or good to other people, which is
    inborn, involuntary, and often unconscious
            
        Azande believe it's an inborn physical substance that manifests itself via psychic
        energy; grows as you get older; witch doesn't know that they're responsible; they
        use oracles to determine who that witch is
        
        the "evil eye"
            etic function: if you believe ppl could cause you harm by looking at you
            enviously, you will be more reserved, less ostentatious

    sorcery: the conscious and intentional use of magical objects, potions, actions, or
    language to cause harm or good to yourself or others

        imitative magic: magic based on the premise that performing a procedure that imitates
        the desired result will produce the desired result

        contagious magic: the belief that things once in contact with a person retain a
        connection with that person
            Jason Giambi's Golden Thong
                not washed - it might wash out the magic!
                he shared it with others

                Todd Helton shaved off his 'unlucky' goatee in a last-ditch attempt to avoid
                having to wear the thong

Magic
    Magic on the natural world
        magic designed to influence important events

        often through sacrifices, ritual performances, or liturgical incantations

    Magic on the supernatural world
        _divination_: rituals performed to gain knowledge that is otherwise unknowable

        _oracles_: people or processes that can reveal hidden knowledge about the past,
        present, or future
