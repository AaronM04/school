what is anthropology?
    anthropos: man or human
    logos: study

anthropology is the study of humans

it is a holistic discipline
    everything about humans: biologically, socially, and culturally
    study ppl - all around the world, and all through time
    of all the disciplines that study humans - anthropology is by far the broadest in scope

cultural anthropology
----

what is culture?
    more than just art or music
    culture is all the stuff we have; the way we behave; and most importantly,
        _the way we think!_
    culture is the lens through which we interpret everything

in our class:
    we will look at different aspects of society:
        family, power, politics, gender, race, class, religion, and economics
    we will see how different cultures define the categories differently and give
    different meanings to them

    we will examine how these aspects of society are interconnected

why study cultural anthropology?
    in a global world, knowing how to understand and communicate with people from
    different cultures is an extremely valuable skill

    studying cultural anthropology will also teach you an awful lot about yourself!

    anthropology can be applied to address real contemporary problems, conflicts,
    processes, and events

goals for the class
    be knowledgeable about core anthropological topics & concepts

    have an appreciation for the diversity of cultures around the world

    have a new perspective on themselves and their own culture

    be able to recognize the role of culture in contemporary problems, conflicts,
    processes, and events

fieldwork
    the cultural anthropologist's rite of passage

    we understand them because "we've been taking the same crap they've been taking"

the prof worked in Oaxaca ("wa HAK uh"), specifically town of San Pablo Coatlan
    Oaxaca is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse states in Mexico
    more than 1/3 of the pop speaks an indigenous language
    state has an isolated and mountainous terrain
    the colonizers wanted to keep the natives from learning Spanish as a means of control
    
    the people made a conscious effort to abandon native languages in the 40's and 50's
    because of perceived discrimination

    in some areas, no private property, but instead, land is held communally

    price of corn and beans driven down in Mexico because of NAFTA

    economists thought marginal producers like those in San Pablo would grow less corn

    instead, the producers grew more corn - the farmers didn't have anything else
    to grow - the prof wanted to understand this

        as a result, they cleared more land - slash and burn
        can be sustainable if you do it over a long period of time - field rotation

        can use field to grow corn for 2 years, then abandon because of erosion

-----TA: Grayson Maas--------
    identity and the politics of underrepresentation in science education

    he does elementary school research here in SB
        he focuses on identity

    underrepresentation in science education
        minority groups in science workforce and as degree holders

    mainstream edu policy calls this "achievement gaps"

    deficit model
        assumption: if we fix achievement gap (better test scores), we'd see more equality

        he challenges this assumption - not about test scores
        more about identity!

    [science] identity
        "science for all" (AAAS 1989)

        he believes:
            good grades + genuine affinity for science != "I'm a 'smart science person'"

            reason: societal factors shape who we think we are

            draw a scientist: you get a white male (drawn by 1st grader) chemist/physicist

            ethnography study of elementary classroom in Michigan
                the top two science students were black females - didn't think of themselves
                as scientists because they were "not like them" (white males)
    identity
        emergent representation of self

        fluid
        multiple
        shaped by context
        authored by a sense of agency

    learning as content acquisition
        "superficial"

    learning as "becoming..."
        one cannot pull off being a particular kind of person (enacting a particular identity)
        unless one makes visible to (performs for) others one's competence in relevant
        practices, and, in response, others recognize one's performance as ###

    cultural capital
        the case of "intelligence", or "being smart": NOT solely the attributes of the
        individual, but a social construction, one that serves as an indicator, which may
        be evaluated by the way one acts, behaves, performs, speaks, etc.
