Prompt #1: "Describe arranged marriage"

emic approach:

    In cultures where arranged marriages are practiced, people do not consider marriage to be primarily about love, but instead
    about good matches of families.  They think of it as being reckless to marry the person you are in love with, rather
    than the person that would further your family's economic and social goals.  When considering a partner for their child,
    families are not concerned with the potential partner's romantic compatibility with their child but instead, with the
    reputation of that potential partner and the reputation of his/her family, as well as their wealth and level of education.

etic approach:
    

    Arranged marriages function primarily as cross-links between lineages, resulting in alliances.
    Because the primary purpose of marriages is formation of alliances, and choosing a partner requires a good understanding
    of the economic and political risks and benefits of various suitors' families, this is done by those in the family older
    than the person getting married since they are perceived as having more experience with such issues.

    *** use holism and functionalism

Prompt #2: "is race real?"

    To answer this question, I would need clarification.  If you mean socially,
then it is very real - people are frequently treated differently because of
their skin color, facial structure, and hair type; if you are consistently
treated differently, you will also tend to act differently and have a different
identity, regardless of your genetics.  If you mean biologically, then it is
not real, for a few reasons: there is and always has been gene flow between
geographically separated populations of humans, so genes for behavioral or
athletic characteristics have been very well mixed across all of these
populations, eliminating any correlation between appearance and said
characteristics; also, from a genetic perspective, there are very few
differences between any two humans, compared to differences within non-human
species.
