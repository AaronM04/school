Lecture 18

economic anthropology
    economists make two assumptions about rationality that anthropologists criticize
        economists assume that maximizing profit is the only rational strategy
            Chayanov and Cornelio helped to show us that this assumption is false
        economists assume that ppl are self-interested
            anth'ists argue that ppl pursue their self-interest, but only within a range
            that is deemed culturally and morally acceptable

economic exchange principles:
    redistribution
    market principle
    reciprocity
        general
        balanced
        negative

in most cultures, ppl use all of these forms of exchange

redistribution:
    two stages:
        first: goods, services, or their equivalent move from individuals and families to
        a center

        second: the goods are redistributed out from the center either back to the same ppl
        that paid in, or to a different set of ppl
    every society has a redistribution system
        our society:
            taxation, lottery, insurance
        other societies:
            the Moka, the Potlatch

    functions of redistribution
        increase equity and ease social tension
        allows societies to set and accomplish goals

market principle:
    items are bought and sold using money
    prices are set (in theory) by supply and demand
    both parties are primarily interested in maximizing their profits (not in the social
    relationship)
    both parties will bargain or "shop around"

    the assumption is that ppl care only about pursuing their on self-interest
        when this is true, these market exchanges are the same as negative reciprocity

    _ppl pursue their self-interest, but only w/in a range that is deemed culturally &
    morally appropriate_

    [dictator game: ]

    [ultimatum game:
        much more of the class would offer at least $30
        2/3rds of the class: if you were offered $20; nobody gets anything!]

    the ppl who come closest to behaving "rationally" live in non-market economies!
        Machiguenga (tribe in Peruvian rainforest)
            most common offer is only 15% (ultimatum game)
            3/4 of offers are less than 30%
            only 10% of the offers are rejected

    _ppl pursue their self-interest, but only w/in a range that is deemed culturally &
    morally appropriate_
        in market-based economies:
            ppl make exchgs w/ strangers all the time
            there are tacit rules for fairness when dealing w/ strangers
        among small-scale horticulturalists and foragers:
            there are rules for exchanges w/ ppl they know
            exchgs w/ strangers are relatively rare
            there are fewer rules for fairness when dealing w/ strangers

    the ethics of market exchanges
        when buying or selling, it may be unethical to bargain too aggressively
            Whittle tells story about the couch he was buying from the widow

            used-car salesmen violate this rule, so they have a bad reputation
        when selling, it can be unethical to aggressively exploit a captive clientele
            profiteering

    social relationships are important in market exchanges

    purely anonymous exchanges are inefficient because they entail a lot of risk
        ebay: established relationships and reputations by ratings

reciprocity:
    _reciprocity_: exchange btwn ppl who are more or less equal
        family -----incr. social distance-----> stranger
        general             balanced            negative
        reciprocity:        reciprocity:        reciprocity:
        giving w/ no        giving w/ an        giving as little as possible,
        expectation of      expectation of a    and trying to get as much as
        return              "fair" return       possible in return

    different styles of reciprocity _reflect_ the social distance btwn the exchangers

    the style of reciprocity can _change_ the social relationship

Gifts
    culture determines the way ppl think about and give meaning to gifts

    in American culture, most gifts are a form of balanced reciprocity
        there is an expectation of return
        giving and receiving gifts affects social relationships

    in many cultures, the social impacts of gifts are more important than the gift

    gifts are social tools that have many functions

Social functions of gifts
    effects of gifts:
        gifts create indebtedness and social obligations
            in many cultures, including our own, it is an insult to reciprocate too quickly;
            it signals a settling of debts and breaking off of the relationship

        gifts can change the status of the giver and the reciever
            "it is better to give than to receive"

    social functions of gifts:
        to nurture long-term relationships
        to manipulate ppl
        to elevate one's own status, or to embarrass one's rivals
            ex: Ongka's Big Moka - "I have knocked you down by giving so much"

Responding to gifts
    the rules for responding to gifts are correlated w/ the cultural ideas about the function
    of gifts

    in American culture, our idea is that gifts are an act of altruism and generosity
        appropriate response: praise the gift and the giver

        ethnocentrically, we think this is the only "proper" way to respond to a gift

    in many other cultures, they recognize the social functions and obligations of gifts
        gifts may cause indebtedness:
            appropriate response: downplay the gift and reduce your indebtedness

        gifts may elevate the status of the giver:
            appropriate response: downplay the gift and maintain social equality

from "within" to "between" cultures
    _holism_: cultures are internally and externally integrated

    _internal integration_: the different aspects of culture:
        kinship, politics, stratification, race, gender, religion, economics

    _external integration_: the relationships btwn societies

two worlds
    one part, the minority (mostly European descendents), is rich and prosperous

    the other part, the majority of countries, is poor and "underdeveloped"

    why?
        from the perspective of our history:
            the first world countries progressed
            the third world countries are stuck and "backward"

        from the perspective of a global history:
            the first world is on top because the third world is on the bottom
            the third world is not stuck down, it was pushed down
