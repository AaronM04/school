Each Student will write a 5-6 page research paper, which will be due on Monday, July 29th.
The topic of your paper will be a contemporary cultural "problem". You will have wide 
latitude in defining the "problem" you wish to address, and you are encouraged to choose a 
topic that interests you. However, some topics will work better than others for this 
assignment and you should heed your TA and instructor's advice. 
The paper will have two parts. In part A, you will use the perspective of anthropology and 
the concept of culture to define and describe the problem ethnographically. In part B, you 
will propose a plan to apply anthropology to ameliorate the problem through ethnography, 
problem research, policy research, or direct engagement.
