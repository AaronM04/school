Lecture 16

Ongka "knocked them down with the size of his gift"
men all live together in a mens' house
each woman has her own house, with the pigs - taking care of them is woman's work
Ongka gets another wife to look after more pigs

why are pigs so important? pigs are power
    "pigs are our strong thing" - just like money is Europeans' strong thing

he doesn't actually want the pigs - he's interested in the social relationships the pigs build

Components of society (we've seen this slide before)
    Super-structure: ideologies
        knowledge, science
        religion, magic
    Structure: social and political relationships
        marriage, family, kinship
        gender, race, ethnicity
        class, caste, politics
    Infrastructure
        the economy:
            ***what we're going to do now
            production
            exchange

Economic anthropology
    economy: the system of production, distribution, and consumption of resources in a society

    subsistence strategy: the way a group of people transform the material resources of their
    environment into food, clothing, shelter, and other material items

    an economic production typology?
        foraging
        horticulture
        agriculture
        pastoralism
        industrialism

Kawelka economy:
    mainly horticulture: sweet potatoes
    also animal husbandry: pigs
    agriculture: coffee
    foraging: forest products

every society relies on a combination of different subsistence strategies

foraging
    foraging: a subsistence strategy that depends on gathering and hunting what can be found
    in nature
    
        usually called "hunting and gathering"

        most foragers subsist on a wide variety of food

        have an intimate and expansive knowledge of their environments

    prior to 12,000 years ago all humans were foragers

    recent and contemporary foragers are not great examples of ancient foragers
        most contemporary foragers are found in marginal environments unsuitable for
        agriculture

        contemporary foragers live in small bands; may be consequence of living in marginal
        environments

        Kwakiutl: no domesticated plants and animals, but huge political organizations
            lived in rich environments

            most pre-agriculture foragers probably lived somewhere in between

Cultivation
    there are two cultivation strategies: horticulture and agriculture

    the earliest cultivators lived ~12,000 years ago in the Fertile crescent
        neolithic (new tools) revolution

    other independent centers of crop domestication:
        ~10,000 years ago in southwest Asia
        ~7-8000 years ago in Africa and the Americas

        arose independently at least 4 times

Why cultivate?
    progressivist theory: adopting agriculture was a huge step toward progress

    revisionist theory: adopting agriculture was done only out of necessity or by force
        replacing quality for quantity

    the evidence supports the revisionist theory:
        1. foraging entails less work and more leisure than agriculture
        2. foragers have high quality protein-rich diets. Agriculture is based primarily on
        low-quality carbohydrates
        3. foragers have less malnutrition and fewer epidemic diseases
        4. foragers have greater food security
            diverse and secure -> narrow and vulnerable (wheat, rice, corn)
            famines are unique to agricultural society

    why did people switch from foraging to cultivation?
        5. growing populations were forced to trade quality for quantity
            intensify their own land use or expand into new areas

who benefits?
    in many ways YOU and I are better off than foragers!
        in addition to enabling larger populations, agriculture enables greater social
        stratification

        "with the advent of agriculture an elite became better off, but most people became
        worse off"
            -Jared Diamond

    you and I are near the very top of a global stratification system

    our lifestyles would not be possible if there weren't people much worse off than us!
        we depend on the labor of poeple much poorer than us
        we depend on the prodigious use of nonrenewable energy

Horticulture
    horticulture: a cultivation strategy that does not use land intensively

    horticulture depends on simple, nonmechanized technology and human labor

    swidden or "slash-and-burn" techniques
        vegetation is cut, allowed to dry, and then burned

        burning clears debris and provides some nutrients

        plots are cultivated for 2-3 years; left fallow to regenerate for 10-60 years
            San Pablo: only cultivate for 2 years

        environmental impact of swidden farming is less than that of agriculture

        sustainability depends on balancing cultivation and regeneration

agriculture
    agriculture: a cultivation strategy that uses land continuously and intensively
    domesticated animals
    irrigation
    terracing

industrial agriculture: animal and human labor replaced by machines & petrochemicals
