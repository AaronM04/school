an etic view of marriage functions
--
procreation: sex and kids
    procreation functions of marriage:
        1. to pair sexual partners
        2. to control the spouses' sexual access w/ others
            only women are 100% sure the kids are hers!
                in patrilineal societies, there is a cultural need to control
                female sexuality
                    - restrict contact w/ other men
                    - surgically close vagina

                in matrilineal societies, there is much less preoccupation w/
                regulating sex
        3. to confer certain sexual rights btwn marriage partners

obligation: raising kids
    marriage functions to determine who has obligations for raising the child

labor: combining sexually divided labor
    physically, there are few tasks that cannot be done by both sexes

    but all cultures divide labor by sex

alliances: relationships btwn kinship groups
    the fcn of marriage extends beyond the married couple to bond larger groups together
        leads to traditions of _arranged marriage_

        may explain the origin of the _incest taboo_

        powerful or rich families may want to avoid alliances which would divide
        their wealth or dilute their power

    preferred cousin marriages
        cross-cousin marriage: not in your lineage, not incest, marrying cross-cousins
        reinforces alliances btwn lineages (exogamy)

        parallel cousin marriage: are in your lineage, marrying parallel cousins prevents
        dividing and diluting power, property, and wealth (endogamy)

marriage rules
    rule #1: eligibility
        exogamy: a rule specifying that a person must marry outside a particular group
            incest taboos: rules found in every society that prohibit sexual relations
            and marriage btwn certain relatives

            incest taboos are universal only for nuclear families

            _exogamy rules serve to promote broader alliances_
        
        endogamy: a rule specifying that a person must marry within a particular group
            _endogamy rules can preserve culture, religion, property, or power_

    rule #2: how many spouses
        monogamy: a rule that permits a person to be married to only one person at a time
            serial monogamy: several spouses, but only one at a time

        polygamy: a rule allowing more than one spouse

        polygyny: a rule allowing men to have more than one wife
            sex ratio problem

            one solution: older men marry younger women

            sororal polygyny: two or more sisters marry one man
                - fairly common; reduces tension among wives

        polyandry: a rule allowing women to have more than one husband
            only in India, Tibet, Nepal, some N. Amer societies

            problems: uncertain paternity and limited fertility

            fraternal polyandry: two or more brothers marry one woman

            does not mean high status for women! more associated w/ female infanticide
            reducing numbers of women

        why more polygyny than polyandry? having more spouses increases a man's fertility but
        not a woman's fertility

marriage exchanges:
    bride wealth
        husband's kin present formally agreed amounts of goods & money to wife's family

    bride service
        husband works for the wife's family for a specified period of time

    dowry
        bride's kin present goods & money to husband's family or to the new couple

    up until a few decades ago, it was common in the US for the bride's family to
    pay for the wedding

    the role and value of women in these exchanges
    in bride wealth and bride service systems:
        women are recognized to be economically valuable
            husband's family is expected to compensate the bride's family for the loss
            of the woman

        if a woman is educated, then her family will receive higher bride wealth
        payments

    in dowry systems:
        dowry may be controlled by the bride as early inheritance

        or dowry may be a payment to the husband's family to compensate for the
        economic burden a woman presents
