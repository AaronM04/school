hegemony: the constr. of ideologies, beliefs, & values that attempt to justify
a stratification system (unequal distrib. of power & privilege) in a society

"back to sex & gender"
--
sex: the biological differences btwn male & female
    we _have_ a sex: male, female, intersexed

sexuality: the way someone is sexually attracted to another person of the opposite
sex, the same sex, both sexes, or no sexes.
    we _have_ a sexuality: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual

gender: culturally defined roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that are considered
appropriate for women, men, and other recognized groups
    but we _do_ a gender

gender ideology: the totality of ideas about sex, gender, the nature of men and women,
including their sexuality, and the relations btwn the genders

gender ideologies define _ideal types_ of gender
    in many cultures there are more than 2 ideal types
    gender ideals vary btwn cultures

gender ideologies in American culture are changing
    increasing acceptance of diff. sexualities

    increasing recognition of diff. gender categories for all sexes & sexualities

gender policing: the act of judging individuals and trying to push them to conform to
an ideal gender type
    passive instruction & reinforcement
    restricting options to "gender appropriate choices"
    teasing us when we "fail" at gender
    physical violence

in some ways we are all policed and act as gender police ourselves

gender stratification
    stratification: the unequal division of status, wealth, or power in a society

    gender stratification: the cultural ways that status, roles, and power are divided
    among the genders w/in a society

    high gender stratification (large differences btwn the genders) is uniformly assoc.
    w/ low status of women

components of society
    "from Marxist ideologies"

    pyramid (top to bottom): super-structure, structure, infrastructure

    infrastructure: environent, biology, economy, technology

    structures: social & political relationships and roles (family, kinship, class,
    caste, political organization)

    ideologies: knowledge, science, religion, art

    you're a materialist if you think material changes (economy, etc.) change higher
    levels (social & political relationships & roles, ideologies)

theories on gender stratification
    ideological explanations: ideologies and religions
        religion is primarily responsible for gender stratification

    structural explanations: social and political structures
        the private-public dichotomy theory
        kinship & residence rules determine gender stratification

    materialist explanations: biology, environment, and economy
        gender stratification is a result of biological differences
        economic production systems determine gender stratification

    all of the above: the holistic approach
        "most anth'ists believe in _all_ of the above, not any one explanation"
        to understand cultural phenomena, we need to understand material, structural, &
        ideological variables

        and how those variables interact in a particular culture

    to understand and to address social problems we must recognize the role of:
        ideological variables: ideologies & religions
        structural variables: social & political structures
        material variables: biology, environment, & economy

    opportunidades: a materialist approach to reducing gender stratification in Mexico
        kind of like a welfare program run by the Federal gov't

        women are given cash and are told to be responsible for it; told what to spend
        the money on (taking care of their children)
            penalties: amount of money reduced if children don't get vaccinated, etc.

        "empowers" women by giving them direct economic aid

        statistically a success

        but there are problems:
            it does not sufficiently address the _structural_ relationships btwn men & women
            
            does not address the _ideology_ of the men

            result: it is placing many women in danger! (they are beaten when they refuse
            to hand the money over to their husbands)

political anthropology
    the typology and ethnography approaches

    the _typology approach_ attempts to classify all societies into discrete categories
    based on certain variables
        "people like to classify things"

    the _ethnography approach_ attempts to use certain key concepts to _understand_ power
    and politics w/in and btwn _specific societies_

political typology:
    political organization typology: categorize societies based on size, degree of authority,
    level of wealth, and economic production systems

    band
        small groups (20-50 ppl)
        foragers
        "egalitarian"

    tribe
        larger groups
        culturally distinct
        mostly "egalitarian"
        "charismatic" leaders

    chiefdom
        several communities
        autonomous
        formal authority
        "rank"
            divisions in power but no divisions in access to economic production

        ***Trobriand islanders - they have a chief who can impose his will on others

    state
        large-scale
        centralized gov'ts
        citizenship not kinship (unlike the above)
        stratified
            permanent inequalities based on distribution of power & wealth

    problem: the political organization typology reinforces the _false notion_ of Unilineal
    Cultural Evolution
        not all societies developed along band -> tribe -> chiefdom -> state

    originally, we were probably bands
    some bands developed into tribes
    eventually one state developed and crushed/co-opted everything else

    lumping societies into ideal types obscures differences that are particular to each
    society

    however, these variables that the typologies use are really important
        size & complexity of society, degree of social differentiation, degree of authority,
        economic production, wealth, and distribution system

        Boas - "cultures are products of their unique history"

    political anth'ists use the ethnographic approach to understand these variables in
    particular cultures

    power: the ability to compel other individuals to do things that they would not choose
    to do of their own accord

    authority: the ability to cause others to act based on characteristics such as honor,
    status, knowledge, ability, respect, or the holding of formal office

    hegemony: the constr. of ideologies, beliefs, & values that attempt to justify
    unequal distrib. of power, wealth, & prestige in a society

    political ideology: the shared beliefs & values that legitimize the distrib. & use
    of power & authority in a particular society
