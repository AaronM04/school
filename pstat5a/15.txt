Lecture 15 - Simple Linear Regression

Quiz 3 - Wednesday 2013-02-20
    summary statistics (5-# summary)
    correlation (little r)
    regression line

Example: MT vs. final exam scores

the avg score in an exam was 80 and the distrib. of the scores was quite symmetric.

    if you meet a student from this course and don't know anything else
    what guess for final exam score?

        ANS: 80 (the average)

    however, if you know student's MT was 90, can you make better guess?

        yes! can use _linear regression_

    Y: the var that we want to predict/explain (i.e., the final score)
        Y is called the _response_

    X: the var that we use to make the prediction (i.e., the MT score)
        
        X is called the _predictor_

    Scatter plot: final vs. MT
        Y: response
        X: predictor

    the regression line

        when the scatterplot looks like a football-shaped cloud of points,
        ###

        there are many possible lines that could be used to summarize ###

        according to the method of least squares, ###

        we take all points in the scatter plot, and we measure the distance
        from the "best line" - these distances are called _residuals_

        we want to minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals

        residual = yi - y_hat_i  =  yi - (b0 + b1*x1)

    how to compute the regression line?
        ***memorize this!!!

        least-squares linear regression

            Y = b0 + b1*X

            where:

                b1 = r*(sy/sx)          [r is correlation coeff.; s* are s.d.'s of y and x]
                b0 = ybar - b1*xbar

        need to know the intercept and the slope
            b0: intercept
            b1: slope


how to compute the regression line
    the slope and the intercept are summary statistics, since they are computed
    based on the data and they are used to summarize the relationship btwn the two
    variables

interp. of the regression line

    if his/her MT score is X, the _prediction_ for his/her final score will be

        Yhat = b0 + b1*X

interp. of the slope

    pick two students at random from the class _whose MTs differ by one point_

    the _prediction_ for the diff. in their final scores is b1. indeed,

        Y = b0 + b1*X
        Y = b0 + b1*(X+1)

        (b0 + b1*(X+1)) - (b0 + b1*X) = b1*((X+1)-X) = b1

    ex:
        X1 = 70
        X2 = 71

        Y1 = 11.6 + .85*70
        Y2 = 11.6 + .85*71

        Y2-Y1 = .85 = b1

Example:
    taller people have higher incomes?

    Y: income
    X: height

        Y = -84,000 + 1560*X
