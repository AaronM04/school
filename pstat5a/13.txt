Lecture 13

Box plot; histogram
    histogram is more useful

Example: hours of sleep

    How to draw the block?
        count the # of datapoints that falls into each class

        Hours of sleep (X)  Counts  Proportions
        -----------------   -----   ----------
        1<=X<=2             4       4/20 = .2      ### not real numbers; see slide

    The intervals are not necessary to draw the graph

Variables
    Variable: the aspect that differs from subject to subject, individual to individual

        Political learning, age, sex, income

    Data: the ###

Two types of variables:
    quantitative/numerical
        age, height, miles traveled, hours slept, income

    categorical - non-number
        political affiliation, sex, race

Summary of categories
    sample proportion
        counts (each category has a number of occurrences)

        proportions/percentages

Sample proportion
    for ex...
        p hat _ liberal = # of people being Liberals / total # of respondents = 0.32

    p hat is like a probability, but it is empirical

Visualizing categorical data
    ###

    Bar Graph (this is distinct from a histogram)

Summary statistics
    Type of variable    Statistics      Graphs
    -------------       --------        ------
    Quant. Continuous   Mean, SD, ...   histogram, boxplot

Pair of measurements
    two qualitative meas.

    what is their relationship?

    ###

Correlation
    Response and explanatory variables

    Scatter plot:
        [ plot ]

    Positive & negative association

    Sample correlation
        [ crazy formula ]

Example: avg consumption per capita by region in the UK

    Region      Alcohol     Tobacco
    -------     ------      -------

    [ scatter plot - x:alcohol vs y:tobacco ]

Two variables:
    Explanatory variable
        Input into the system

        Explains or predicts the other

    Response variable
        Output of the system

        What we want to predict

    Ex: height of father is explanatory var; height of son is response var

    Scatter plot: x is explanatory var; y is response var

What to look for in a graph:
    linear relationship:
        positive or negative assoc.

    non-linear relationship :)

Positive association
