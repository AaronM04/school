Lecture 17 - sampling distributions II

Ex. avg # cars in US households
    pop. average:
        mu = (average)

    pop. s.d.
        sigma = sqrt(1/(N-1)*[sum for all X of (x-mu)^2])

    very difficult to determine the above, so we use a sample

Sample:
    sample dataset: {X1,...,Xn}
    sample size: n

Goal:
    based on the sample values, {X1, ..., Xn}, where n is the sample size,
    we try to reach some concl. for the params of interest

    the ideal sample:
        representative 
        unbiased

    choose the sample at _random_
        Simple random sample

Simple random sample
    {X1,...,Xn} is a simple random sample if
        i) if a certain member of the pop is chosen, this does not affect the chances of
        another member to be chosen
        ii) every member of the pop is equally likely to be chosen.

    in other words...
        i)  {X1,...,Xn} are independent
        ii) {X1,...,Xn} are identically distributed (i.e., have the same pmf or pdf)
            the above two conditions are referred to as "IID"

Estimation of mu
    An _estimator_ of a param is a _statistic_ whose value in the sample is used
    to estimate this param.
        an estimator for mu is the sample mean, xbar
        an estimator for sigma is the sample s.d., s.

    Examples:
        X1,...,Xn is a sample of n American households.
        an estimate for mu will be
            xbar = (x1 + ... + xn)/n

        An estimator for mu will be
            s = sqrt(1/(n-1)*[sum for all x of (x-xbar)^2])

Properties of xbar
    Question
        ###

Remark
    Xbar is a random var, thus
        it has a distrib., which we will call "sampling distribution"

    Ex:
        diff. researchers collect SRS of households (all w/ same sample size, n)

        then, each researcher will get different sample mean xbar.

Central limit theorem:
    Central Limit Theorem:
        X1, X2, ..., Xn are _indep._ and _identically distrib_ and n is large
        (i.e., n>30), then:

            E(xbar) = mu
            s.d.(xbar) = sigma/sqrt(n)
            xbar ~ N(mu, sigma/sqrt(n))

When:
    i) X1,X2,...,Xn are
        - independent
        - identically distrib.
    ii) n > 30
        then
            xbar ~ Normal(mu, sigma/sqrt(n))

    Examples:
        1) X1,X2,...,X50 ~ Binomial(m=10, p=0.1)
            (n=50)
         xbar = (x1+x2+...+x50)/50
         xbar ~ Normal(mu,sigma/sqrt(50))
         mu = E(X1) = m*p = 10*0.1 = 1
         sigma = sqrt(Var(X1)) = sqrt(m*p*(1-p))
                               = sqrt(10*0.1*0.9)

         xbar ~ N(1, sqrt(10*0.1*0.9)/sqrt(50))
              ^ approximate distrib.

When do we use the CLT?
    how large n should be?

    the central limit theorem does NOT say that every individual
    random variable is approx. normal

    the central limit theory applies _indep. of the distrib. of X._
    it suffices to know its expectation and its s.d.

Example: exam scores
    mean score: 74; s.d. 14; final exam to 64 students

        approximate the prob. that the avg. test scores in the class
        exceeds 80.

        Remark! not mentioned that exam scores are normally distrib.!

    n=64 students
    Xi = the exam score of a student
    X1,X2,...,X64
    E(Xi) = 74 (essentially, this is the mu)
    sigma = sqrt(Var(Xi)) = 14
    xbar = average test score
    if xi are i.i.d.,
        xbar ~ N(74, 14/sqrt(64))
             ^ approx.

        P(xbar > 80) = ?

        ANS: P(xbar > 80) = P(Z>3.429) = 1-P(Z<3.429) = .0003

P(xbar <= 3) = (3-5)/0.83

Population & Sample Proportion

Survey
    Simple Random Sample
    55% are in favor of a statement
    repeat survey
        56% are in favor
        52% are in favor
        ...

Sampling proportion
    ###

Sampling proportion:
    Ex: elections
        X = number of respondants who support the Democrats
        n = total number of respondents in the survey
        phat = X/n = proportion of respondents who support the Democrats

        we _estimate_ the proportion of respondents in the pop. who
        support the democrats based on the sample proportion

Sampling Distrib. of phat
    Expectation
        E(phat) = n*p / n = p

    Standard Deviation
        s_phat = sqrt(p*(1-p) / n)

    Std. error
        s.e.(phat) = sqrt(phat*(1-phat)/n)

Let n get big: n=10, p=0.5, binomial distrib.

Central Limit Theorem
    if n is large enough, the sample proportion phat behaves approx. as 
    a _normal random var_ w/

        mean: mu = p
        s.d.: sigma = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

phat ~ Normal(p, sqrt(p*(1-p)/n))
xbar ~ Normal(mu, sigma/sqrt(n))

    Assumptions
        i)  indep.
        ii) identically distrib.
        iii)n>30 for xbar  |  np > 10; n(1-p) > 10 for phat

When can we use the approximation?
    rule
        a pop. w/ a fixed proportion

        random sample
            indep.
            equally likely
        sample size is large
            np > 10
            n(1-p) > 10

    i.e., this is a binomial expt w/ normal approximation

Ex: tossing a coin n times
    suppose we flip a coin 50 times w/ P(Heads) = 0.25
