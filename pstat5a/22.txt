Lecture 22 (but PDF says Lecture 23!)
Inference on Two Proportions

Are the proportions the same?
    are men or women more likely to go to college?

    ...

What issue is most important to you?
    5409 voters
        economy most important
        2867 support Obama

            phat_1 = 2867/5409 = .53

    859 voters
        war in Iraq most important
        507 voted for Obama

            phat_2 = 507/859 = .59


    Is there a difference in the support of Obama btwn these two groups?

Stastical model

    X1 ~ Bin(n1,p1)
    X2 ~ Bin(n2,p2)
    ###

Null and Alternative Hypotheses
    Null = proportions are the same

        H0: p1 = p2

    Three possible alternatives

        H[alpha]: p1 != p2 (two-sided)  <-- most common
        H[alpha]: p1 > p2 (one-sided)
        H[alpha]: p1 < p2 (one-sided)

Example: hypothesis
    null:
        ###

Estimation
    some algebra on our hypothesis
        ###

        H0: p1 = p2   =>  p1 - p2 = 0

Comparing sample proportions:
    ...
    phat1 - phat2 = -.06 (?)

Sampling distribution of phat1 - phat2
    assumptions
        np > 10 and n(1-p) > 10
        the two samples are independent
        under the null, expectation is 0
        s.d.?

    both n1 and n2; and p1 and p2

X,Y are independent
    Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)

    we want to find Var(p1hat - p2hat)
    Var(p1hat - p2hat) = Var(p1hat) + Var(p2hat)    <--- sign is always a plus!

                                                        reason:
                                                            Var(3X) = 3^2 * Var(X)
                                                                    = 9 * Var(X)


                      = 

If H0 is true...

        X1 + X2 ~ Binomial(n1 + n2, p)

    where p = p1 = p2

        pbar = (X1 + X2) / (n1 + n2)    (proportion if they are not independent)

    under H0
        n = n1 + n2
        p = p1 = p2

            X1 + X2

        pbar = (# of voter support Obama) / (total # of votes)

Standard Deviation
    sd(p1hat - p2hat) = ###   (don't memorize this formula)

X1 - X2 ~ Bin(n1 + n2, p)
E(p1hat - p2hat) = 0
sd(p1hat - p2hat) = ###

Test statistic

    z = ###

    where phat = (X1 + X2) / (n1 + n2)

    this is normal

    p1hat - p2hat = -.05
    ###

Conclusion
    p-value for a two sided test
        P = 2P(Z < -3.28) = ... = .001

    reject the null at level .05

    there is a sig. diff. btwn the two samples
        The voters most interested in the Iraq war were more likely to vote for Obama

###

Sources of bias
    selection bias
        problem in sampling scheme
        diff btwn pop. of interest and effective pop

    non-responsive bias
        subjects don't answer
        skip questions

    response bias
        subjects lie
        interviewer effect

Why those internet polls are worthless
    self-selected sample
        more passionate = more likely to respond

        minority opinion = more passion

        selection bias

Confidence intervals ###

Large sample size, IID pop.
    xbar +/- s/sqrt(n) : 68% CI for mu

    xbar +/- 1.96*s/sqrt(n) : 95% CI for mu

more generally
    xbar - z_(alpha/2)*s/sqrt(n) < mu < xbar + z_(alpha/2)*s/sqrt(n)

n > 30;
    always use z
n < 30:
    IID normal, known sigma:
        ***use z

    IID normal, unknown sigma; known s
        use t

Small sample size, normal ###

...

phat +/- z_(alpha/2)*sqrt(p###

*** new thing below: p0
Test statistic & p-value
    z-test
        z = (phat - p0) / ###

Is it a fair coin?
